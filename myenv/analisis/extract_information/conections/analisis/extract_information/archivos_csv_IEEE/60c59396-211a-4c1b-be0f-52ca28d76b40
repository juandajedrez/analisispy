"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition","K. He; X. Zhang; S. Ren; J. Sun",Microsoft Research; Microsoft Research; Microsoft Research; Microsoft Research,2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),"12 Dec 2016","2016","","","770","778","Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-8851-1","10.1109/CVPR.2016.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780459","","Training;Degradation;Complexity theory;Image recognition;Neural networks;Visualization;Image segmentation","","122833","256","49","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model).

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500–1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.996017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996017","","Genetic algorithms;Sorting;Computational complexity;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Testing;Decision making;Associate members;Diversity reception;Constraint optimization","","33656","14","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors.

An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of ""random"" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity.

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4767851","Edge detection;feature extraction;image processing;machine vision;multiscale image analysis","Image edge detection;Detectors;Machine vision;Shape measurement;Performance analysis;Uncertainty;Gaussian approximation;Signal to noise ratio;Signal synthesis;Feature extraction","","20451","554","31","IEEE","27 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.

In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.","2380-7504","978-1-5386-1032-9","10.1109/ICCV.2017.324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8237586","","Detectors;Training;Entropy;Object detection;Proposals;Robustness;Computer vision","","15954","","37","IEEE","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations.

In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems.

Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.

First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or `atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed “DeepLab” system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection.

This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1] . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3] , DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803544","Deep convolutional neural networks;semantic pixel-wise segmentation;indoor scenes;road scenes;encoder;decoder;pooling;upsampling","Decoding;Neural networks;Training;Computer architecture;Image segmentation;Semantics;Convolutional codes","","12318","","69","CCBY","2 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4767596","Annealing;Gibbs distribution;image restoration;line process;MAP estimate;Markov random field;relaxation;scene modeling;spatial degradation","Stochastic processes;Bayesian methods;Image restoration;Degradation;Markov random fields;Additive noise;Deformable models;Temperature distribution;Energy states;Annealing","","12282","127","52","IEEE","27 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the ""uniform"" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table.

The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that dont have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task.

Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying |T|/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ |/spl Omega/| for some constant C/sub M/>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.862083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580791","Convex optimization;duality in optimization;free probability;image reconstruction;linear programming;random matrices;sparsity;total-variation minimization;trigonometric expansions;uncertainty principle","Robustness;Uncertainty;Signal reconstruction;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Mathematics;Biomedical imaging;Sampling methods;Linear programming;Signal processing","","11716","186","31","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for `dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad- CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology.

We outline several strategies employed by the cooperating radios, including fixed relaying schemes such as amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward, selection relaying schemes that adapt based upon channel measurements between the cooperating terminals, and incremental relaying schemes that adapt based upon limited feedback from the destination terminal. We develop performance characterizations in terms of outage events and associated outage probabilities, which measure robustness of the transmissions to fading, focusing on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Except for fixed decode-and-forward, all of our cooperative diversity protocols are efficient in the sense that they achieve full diversity (i.e., second-order diversity in the case of two terminals), and, moreover, are close to optimum (within 1.5 dB) in certain regimes. Thus, using distributed antennas, we can provide the powerful benefits of space diversity without need for physical arrays, though at a loss of spectral efficiency due to half-duplex operation and possibly at the cost of additional receive hardware.

Chollet","Google, Inc.",2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),"9 Nov 2017","2017","","","1800","1807","We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8099678","","Computer architecture;Correlation;Convolutional codes;Google;Biological neural networks","","10022","23","25","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters.

The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the ""integral image"" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a ""cascade"" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems.

Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ""Fisherface"" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face databases.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.598228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=598228","","Face recognition;Light scattering;Lighting;Face detection;Principal component analysis;Shadow mapping;Light sources;Pattern classification;Pixel;Error analysis","","8893","104","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings asfeature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method.

We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), and report simulation results.

We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by \ell^{1}-minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as Eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483511","Face recognition;feature extraction;occlusion and corruption;sparse representation;compressed sensing;\ell^{1}--minimization;validation and outlier rejection.;Classifier design and evaluation;Face and gesture recognition;Feature evaluation and selection;Occlusion;Spare representation;Outlier rejection","Robustness;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Humans;Lighting;Linear regression;Signal representations;Classification algorithms;Object recognition;Image recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Cluster Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","7750","47","62","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requirement is “artificial” and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, “spatial pyramid pooling”, to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102 $\times$  faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank #2 in object detection and #3 in image classification among all 38 teams.

Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.881199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710377","Atom decomposition;basis pursuit;codebook;dictionary;FOCUSS;gain-shape VQ;matching pursuit;sparse representation;training;vector quantization","Algorithm design and analysis;Dictionaries;Matching pursuit algorithms;Pursuit algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Prototypes;Inverse problems;Feature extraction;Signal design","","7646","76","47","IEEE","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations, 20 000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data.

LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show the LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional outing protocols.

Weakly nonlinear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.798002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=798002","","Conductors;Conducting materials;Microstructure;Magnetic materials;Resonance;Permeability;Sheet materials;Energy resolution;Capacitance;Inductance","","7143","260","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Radio etiquette is the set of RF bands, air interfaces, protocols, and spatial and temporal patterns that moderate the use of the radio spectrum. Cognitive radio extends the software radio with radio-domain model-based reasoning about such etiquettes. Cognitive radio enhances the flexibility of personal services through a radio knowledge representation language. This language represents knowledge of radio etiquette, devices, software modules, propagation, networks, user needs, and application scenarios in a way that supports automated reasoning about the needs of the user. This empowers software radios to conduct expressive negotiations among peers about the use of radio spectrum across fluents of space, time, and user context. With RKRL, cognitive radio agents may actively manipulate the protocol stack to adapt known etiquettes to better satisfy the user's needs. This transforms radio nodes from blind executors of predefined protocols to radio-domain-aware intelligent agents that search out ways to deliver the services the user wants even if that user does not know how to obtain them. Software radio provides an ideal platform for the realization of cognitive radio.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.788210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=788210","","Cognitive radio;Equalizers;Software radio;Application specific integrated circuits;GSM;Software algorithms;Hardware;Radio frequency;Modems;Baseband","","7071","70","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, it has not yet been widely used in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. Each subproblem is optimized by only using information from its several neighboring subproblems, which makes MOEA/D have lower computational complexity at each generation than MOGLS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with simple decomposition methods outperforms or performs similarly to MOGLS and NSGA-II on multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems and continuous multiobjective optimization problems. It has been shown that MOEA/D using objective normalization can deal with disparately-scaled objectives, and MOEA/D with an advanced decomposition method can generate a set of very evenly distributed solutions for 3-objective test instances. The ability of MOEA/D with small population, the scalability and sensitivity of MOEA/D have also been experimentally investigated in this paper.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2007.892759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358754","Computational complexity;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality;Computational complexity;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality","Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Computational complexity;Sorting;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Testing;Scalability;Computer science;Mathematical model","","6924","3","40","IEEE","27 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Until recently the ability to infer evolutionary relationships was limited by the amount of DNA sequence data available, but new DNA sequencing technologies have largely removed this limitation. As a result, DNA sequence data are readily available or obtainable for a wide spectrum of organisms, thus creating an unprecedented opportunity to explore evolutionary relationships broadly and deeply across the Tree of Life. Unfortunately, the algorithms used to infer evolutionary relationships are NP-hard, so the dramatic increase in available DNA sequence data has created a commensurate increase in the need for access to powerful computational resources. Local laptop or desktop machines are no longer viable for analysis of the larger data sets available today, and progress in the field relies upon access to large, scalable high-performance computing resources. This paper describes development of the CIPRES Science Gateway, a web portal designed to provide researchers with transparent access to the fastest available community codes for inference of phylogenetic relationships, and implementation of these codes on scalable computational resources. Meeting the needs of the community has included developing infrastructure to provide access, working with the community to improve existing community codes, developing infrastructure to insure the portal is scalable to the entire systematics community, and adopting strategies that make the project sustainable by the community. The CIPRES Science Gateway has allowed more than 1800 unique users to run jobs that required 2.5 million Service Units since its release in December 2009.

The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8099502","","Image resolution;Signal resolution;Gallium nitride;Image reconstruction;Manifolds;Training;Network architecture","","6789","19","14","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3D data arrays which we call ""groups."" Collaborative Altering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. The result is a 3D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271520","Adaptive grouping;block matching;image denoising;sparsity;3-D transform shrinkage","Image denoising;Collaboration;Filtering;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Energy resolution;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Discrete cosine transforms","Algorithms;Artifacts;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","6674","90","23","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8100117","","Complexity theory;Neurons;Topology;Computer architecture;Neural networks;Network topology","","6666","19","44","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called ""perceptual losses""? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578166","","Distortion;Task analysis;Measurement;Visualization;Training;Network architecture;Computer architecture","","6237","11","20","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is /spl Theta/(W/spl radic/An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825799","","Information rates","","6233","87","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since 1985, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the strength Pareto EA (SPEA), that combines several features of previous multiobjective EAs in a unique manner. It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, (b) evaluating an individual's fitness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that dominate it, (c) preserving population diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and (d) incorporating a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained on two artificial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis of a digital hardware-software multiprocessor system, suggest that SPEA can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff surface. Moreover, SPEA clearly outperforms the other four multiobjective EAs on the 0/1 knapsack problem.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.797969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=797969","","Evolutionary computation;Computer aided software engineering;Pareto optimization;Computer architecture;Space exploration;Multiprocessing systems;Sampling methods;Hardware;Software systems;Cost function","","6200","11","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has three main distinguishing features: 1) use of so-called ``linguistic'' variables in place of or in addition to numerical variables; 2) characterization of simple relations between variables by fuzzy conditional statements; and 3) characterization of complex relations by fuzzy algorithms. A linguistic variable is defined as a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language. Thus, if tall, not tall, very tall, very very tall, etc. are values of height, then height is a linguistic variable. Fuzzy conditional statements are expressions of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B have fuzzy meaning, e.g., IF x is small THEN y is large, where small and large are viewed as labels of fuzzy sets. A fuzzy algorithm is an ordered sequence of instructions which may contain fuzzy assignment and conditional statements, e.g., x = very small, IF x is small THEN Y is large. The execution of such instructions is governed by the compositional rule of inference and the rule of the preponderant alternative. By relying on the use of linguistic variables and fuzzy algorithms, the approach provides an approximate and yet effective means of describing the behavior of systems which are too complex or too ill-defined to admit of precise mathematical analysis.","2168-2909","","10.1109/TSMC.1973.5408575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5408575","","Economic forecasting;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy sets;Econometrics;Algorithm design and analysis;Humans;Animation;Navigation;Biological systems;Computer simulation","","6125","43","21","IEEE","8 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.","","978-1-5090-5407-7","10.1109/3DV.2016.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785132","Deep learning;segmentation;prostate;machine learning;convolutional neural networks","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Neural networks;Magnetic resonance imaging;Two dimensional displays","","5996","14","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128907","Imbalanced learning;classification;sampling methods;cost-sensitive learning;kernel-based learning;active learning;assessment metrics.","Availability;Large-scale systems;Surveillance;Data security;IP networks;Finance;Data analysis;Decision making;Data engineering;Knowledge representation","","5791","8","145","IEEE","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we take one step forward by investigating the construction of feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs) to embrace the progress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm, and regularization method into image denoising. Specifically, residual learning and batch normalization are utilized to speed up the training process as well as boost the denoising performance. Different from the existing discriminative denoising models which usually train a specific model for additive white Gaussian noise at a certain noise level, our DnCNN model is able to handle Gaussian denoising with unknown noise level (i.e., blind Gaussian denoising). With the residual learning strategy, DnCNN implicitly removes the latent clean image in the hidden layers. This property motivates us to train a single DnCNN model to tackle with several general image denoising tasks, such as Gaussian denoising, single image super-resolution, and JPEG image deblocking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our DnCNN model can not only exhibit high effectiveness in several general image denoising tasks, but also be efficiently implemented by benefiting from GPU computing.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2017.2662206","HK RGC GRF(grant numbers:PolyU 5313/13E); National Natural Scientific Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671182,61471146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839189","Image denoising;convolutional neural networks;residual learning;batch normalization","Noise reduction;Image denoising;Training;Computational modeling;Noise level;Neural networks;Transform coding","","5582","","48","IEEE","1 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.906424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906424","","Hidden Markov models;Image segmentation;Brain modeling;Expectation-maximization algorithms;Mathematical model;Magnetic resonance;Noise level;Stochastic processes;State estimation;Robustness","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains","5559","13","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EMD is known for limitations like sensitivity to noise and sampling. These limitations could only partially be addressed by more mathematical attempts to this decomposition problem, like synchrosqueezing, empirical wavelets or recursive variational decomposition. Here, we propose an entirely non-recursive variational mode decomposition model, where the modes are extracted concurrently. The model looks for an ensemble of modes and their respective center frequencies, such that the modes collectively reproduce the input signal, while each being smooth after demodulation into baseband. In Fourier domain, this corresponds to a narrow-band prior. We show important relations to Wiener filter denoising. Indeed, the proposed method is a generalization of the classic Wiener filter into multiple, adaptive bands. Our model provides a solution to the decomposition problem that is theoretically well founded and still easy to understand. The variational model is efficiently optimized using an alternating direction method of multipliers approach. Preliminary results show attractive performance with respect to existing mode decomposition models. In particular, our proposed model is much more robust to sampling and noise.

Data is encoded by a channel code and the encoded data is split into n streams that are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals perturbed by noise. We derive performance criteria for designing such codes under the assumption that the fading is slow and frequency nonselective. Performance is shown to be determined by matrices constructed from pairs of distinct code sequences. The minimum rank among these matrices quantifies the diversity gain, while the minimum determinant of these matrices quantifies the coding gain. The results are then extended to fast fading channels. The design criteria are used to design trellis codes for high data rate wireless communication. The encoding/decoding complexity of these codes is comparable to trellis codes employed in practice over Gaussian channels. The codes constructed here provide the best tradeoff between data rate, diversity advantage, and trellis complexity. Simulation results are provided for 4 and 8 PSK signal sets with data rates of 2 and 3 bits/symbol, demonstrating excellent performance that is within 2-3 dB of the outage capacity for these channels using only 64 state encoders.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.661517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=661517","","Space time codes;Wireless communication;Fading;Transmitting antennas;Convolutional codes;Receiving antennas;Frequency;Diversity methods;Decoding;Gaussian channels","","5483","252","44","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each mobile host operates as a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic self starting network, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance vector routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks.

Computational elements or nodes are connected via weights that are typically adapted during use to improve performance. There has been a recent resurgence in the field of artificial neural nets caused by new net topologies and algorithms, analog VLSI implementation techniques, and the belief that massive parallelism is essential for high performance speech and image recognition. This paper provides an introduction to the field of artificial neural nets by reviewing six important neural net models that can be used for pattern classification. These nets are highly parallel building blocks that illustrate neural net components and design principles and can be used to construct more complex systems. In addition to describing these nets, a major emphasis is placed on exploring how some existing classification and clustering algorithms can be performed using simple neuron-like components. Single-layer nets can implement algorithms required by Gaussian maximum-likelihood classifiers and optimum minimum-error classifiers for binary patterns corrupted by noise. More generally, the decision regions required by any classification algorithm can be generated in a straightforward manner by three-layer feed-forward nets.","1558-1284","","10.1109/MASSP.1987.1165576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1165576","","Neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Biology computing;Clustering algorithms;Biological system modeling;Image recognition;Classification algorithms;Concurrent computing","","5355","278","48","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.969114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969114","","Labeling;Image restoration;Stereo vision;Minimization methods;Markov random fields;Energy measurement;Computer vision;Approximation algorithms;Simulated annealing;Motion estimation","","5342","127","47","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data is encoded using a space-time block code and the encoded data is split into n streams which are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals perturbed by noise. Maximum-likelihood decoding is achieved in a simple way through decoupling of the signals transmitted from different antennas rather than joint detection. This uses the orthogonal structure of the space-time block code and gives a maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm which is based only on linear processing at the receiver. Space-time block codes are designed to achieve the maximum diversity order for a given number of transmit and receive antennas subject to the constraint of having a simple decoding algorithm. The classical mathematical framework of orthogonal designs is applied to construct space-time block codes. It is shown that space-time block codes constructed in this way only exist for few sporadic values of n. Subsequently, a generalization of orthogonal designs is shown to provide space-time block codes for both real and complex constellations for any number of transmit antennas. These codes achieve the maximum possible transmission rate for any number of transmit antennas using any arbitrary real constellation such as PAM. For an arbitrary complex constellation such as PSK and QAM, space-time block codes are designed that achieve 1/2 of the maximum possible transmission rate for any number of transmit antennas. For the specific cases of two, three, and four transmit antennas, space-time block codes are designed that achieve, respectively, all, 3/4, and 3/4 of maximum possible transmission rate using arbitrary complex constellations. The best tradeoff between the decoding delay and the number of transmit antennas is also computed and it is shown that many of the codes presented here are optimal in this sense as well.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.771146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=771146","","Block codes","","5282","285","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned, with roughly equal numbers of service antennas and terminals and frequency-division duplex operation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as large-scale antenna systems, very large MIMO, hyper MIMO, full-dimension MIMO, and ARGOS) makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a large excess of service antennas over active terminals and time-division duplex operation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever smaller regions of space to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency. Other benefits of massive MIMO include extensive use of inexpensive low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the MAC layer, and robustness against intentional jamming. The anticipated throughput depends on the propagation environment providing asymptotically orthogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed any limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional research problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently need attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components that work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for newly joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided by the excess of service antennas, reducing internal power consumption to achieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment scenarios. This article presents an overview of the massive MIMO concept and contemporary research on the topic.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6736761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736761","","MIMO;Base stations;Antenna arrays;Uplink;Fading;Downlink","","5202","47","21","IEEE","12 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Han","Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,"27 Feb 2009","2009","56","3","900","906","Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) can be summarized as follows: it inherits from proportional-integral-derivative (PID) the quality that makes it such a success: the error driven, rather than model-based, control law; it takes from modern control theory its best offering: the state observer; it embraces the power of nonlinear feedback and puts it to full use; it is a useful digital control technology developed out of an experimental platform rooted in computer simulations. ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over 80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4) complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of innovations.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.2011621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796887","Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC);extended state observer (ESO);nonlinear proportional–integral–derivative (PID);tracking differentiator","Three-term control;Pi control;Proportional control;Error correction;Computer errors;Control theory;State feedback;Digital control;Computer simulation;Industrial control","","5062","4","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time-division duplex operation combined with reverse-link pilots enables the base station to estimate the reciprocal forward- and reverse-link channels. The conjugate-transpose of the channel estimates are used as a linear precoder and combiner respectively on the forward and reverse links. Propagation, unknown to both terminals and base station, comprises fast fading, log-normal shadow fading, and geometric attenuation. In the limit of an infinite number of antennas a complete multi-cellular analysis, which accounts for inter-cellular interference and the overhead and errors associated with channel-state information, yields a number of mathematically exact conclusions and points to a desirable direction towards which cellular wireless could evolve. In particular the effects of uncorrelated noise and fast fading vanish, throughput and the number of terminals are independent of the size of the cells, spectral efficiency is independent of bandwidth, and the required transmitted energy per bit vanishes. The only remaining impairment is inter-cellular interference caused by re-use of the pilot sequences in other cells (pilot contamination) which does not vanish with unlimited number of antennas.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2010.092810.091092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5595728","Multiuser MIMO;pilot contamination;noncooperative cellular wireless;active antenna arrays","Base stations;Antennas;OFDM;Fading;MIMO;Arrays","","5062","229","22","IEEE","7 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work is related to the problem of finding sparse solutions to vastly underdetermined systems of linear equations. There are also significant connections with the problem of recovering signals from highly incomplete measurements. In fact, the results introduced in this paper improve on our earlier work.

However, more than 35 years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates. Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the UT.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.823141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271397","","Filtering;Nonlinear systems;Target tracking;Control systems;Particle tracking;Kalman filters;Vehicles;Navigation;Chemical processes;Nonlinear control systems","","4979","21","52","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. Forj > 3and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound.","2168-2712","","10.1109/TIT.1962.1057683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1057683","","Parity check codes;Maximum likelihood decoding;Equations;Channel capacity;Information theory;Error probability;Linear approximation;Data communication;Error correction codes;Communication systems","","4976","489","8","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-0356-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638947","recurrent neural networks;deep neural networks;speech recognition","Speech recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Training;Vectors;Acoustics;Noise","","4961","112","27","IEEE","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498756","Index Terms- Local descriptors;interest points;interest regions;invariance;matching;recognition.","Detectors;Filters;Robustness;Image recognition;Information retrieval;Image retrieval;Performance evaluation;Layout;Image databases;Spatial databases","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","4837","192","45","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases.

How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such ""all-together"" methods. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: ""one-against-all,"" ""one-against-one,"" and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM). Our experiments indicate that the ""one-against-one"" and DAG methods are more suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in general need fewer support vectors.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.991427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991427","","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Optimization methods;Large-scale systems;Computer science;Training data","","4696","10","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To cope with natural image changes, this classifier is typically trained with translated and scaled sample patches. Such sets of samples are riddled with redundancies—any overlapping pixels are constrained to be the same. Based on this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands of translated patches. By showing that the resulting data matrix is circulant, we can diagonalize it with the discrete Fourier transform, reducing both storage and computation by several orders of magnitude. Interestingly, for linear regression our formulation is equivalent to a correlation filter, used by some of the fastest competitive trackers. For kernel regression, however, we derive a new kernelized correlation filter (KCF), that unlike other kernel algorithms has the exact same complexity as its linear counterpart. Building on it, we also propose a fast multi-channel extension of linear correlation filters, via a linear kernel, which we call dual correlation filter (DCF). Both KCF and DCF outperform top-ranking trackers such as Struck or TLD on a 50 videos benchmark, despite running at hundreds of frames-per-second, and being implemented in a few lines of code (Algorithm 1). To encourage further developments, our tracking framework was made open-source.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2345390","FCT(grant numbers:PTDC/EEA-CRO/122812/2010,SFRH/BD75459/2010,SFRH/BD74152/2010,SFRH/BPD/90200/2012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6870486","Visual tracking;circulant matrices;discrete Fourier transform;kernel methods;ridge regression;correlation filters","Correlation;Kernel;Discrete Fourier transforms;Target tracking;Vectors;Complexity theory;Training","","4657","","36","IEEE","1 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by: (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes; (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image.

Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as ""eigenfaces,"" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn.1991.3.1.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793549","","","","4627","17","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The classifier consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector, that is, trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces. The subspace method is compared to single-tree classifiers and other forest construction methods by experiments on publicly available datasets, where the method's superiority is demonstrated.

This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the “generalized” single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times) than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2168604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035797","Extreme learning machine (ELM);feature mapping;kernel;least square support vector machine (LS-SVM);proximal support vector machine (PSVM);regularization network","Support vector machines;Optimization;Kernel;Training;Feedforward neural networks;Machine learning;Approximation methods","","4611","4","56","IEEE","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana.

However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner.

In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6600851","Many-objective optimization;evolutionary computation;large dimension;NSGA-III;non-dominated sorting;multi-criterion optimization;Evolutionary computation;large dimension;many-objective optimization;multicriterion optimization;nondominated sorting;NSGA-III","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Vectors;Measurement;Zirconium;Educational institutions","","4446","","63","IEEE","16 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body.

Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.788640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=788640","","Statistical learning;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Loss measurement;Support vector machines;Algorithm design and analysis;Multidimensional systems;Risk management;Probability distribution","","4412","13","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h Ω to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the oscillation frequency. The existence of ""noise enhancing"" and ""noise quieting"" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.","1558-2256","","10.1109/PROC.1963.1664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443594","","Quantum mechanics;Masers;Frequency;Electromagnetic radiation;Stability;Noise level;Electromagnetic fields;Tellurium;Energy exchange;Coherence","","4380","2","17","IEEE","28 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More precisely, on a quasi static channel where a code word spans across only one time and frequency coherence interval, the reliability of a point-to-point MIMO link scales according to Prob(link outage) ` SNR-ntnr where nt and nr are the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively, and signal-to-noise ratio is denoted by SNR. On a channel that varies rapidly as a function of time and frequency, and where circumstances permit coding across many channel coherence intervals, the achievable rate scales as min(nt, nr) log(1 + SNR).

These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups.

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOM.1983.1095851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1095851","","Laplace equations;Image coding;Low pass filters;Data compression;Shape;Frequency;Pixel;Entropy;Data structures;Image sampling","","4325","321","13","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved.

In these methods, the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better (+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude faster than previous CNN-based methods.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-8851-1","10.1109/CVPR.2016.207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780576","","Image resolution;Convolution;Neural networks;Image reconstruction;Interpolation;Feature extraction;Convolutional codes","","4307","26","26","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots.

The position attention module selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other regardless of their distances.

Jacobson","Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA; Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,"6 Aug 2002","1993","1","4","397","413","The authors present random early detection (RED) gateways for congestion avoidance in packet-switched networks. The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing the average queue size. The gateway could notify connections of congestion either by dropping packets arriving at the gateway or by setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue size exceeds a present threshold, the gateway drops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, where the exact probability is a function of the average queue size. RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowing occasional bursts of packets in the queue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies a particular connection to reduce its window is roughly proportional to that connection's share of the bandwidth through the gateway. RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestion control protocol such as TCP. The RED gateway has no bias against bursty traffic and avoids the global synchronization of many connections decreasing their window at the same time. Simulations of a TCP/IP network are used to illustrate the performance of RED gateways.<>","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.251892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=251892","","Transport protocols;Delay effects;Throughput;Propagation delay;Bandwidth;TCPIP;Traffic control;High-speed networks;Feedback;Delay estimation","","4268","341","38","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on these optimizations and EfficientNet backbones, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called EfficientDet, which consistently achieve much better efficiency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints.

Unfortunately, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: given an input x and any target classification t, it is possible to find a new input x' that is similar to x but classified as t. This makes it difficult to apply neural networks in security-critical areas. Defensive distillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural network, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current attacks' ability to find adversarial examples from 95% to 0.5%. In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not significantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three new attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled neural networks with 100% probability. Our attacks are tailored to three distance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to previous adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much more effective (and never worse). Furthermore, we propose using high-confidence adversarial examples in a simple transferability test we show can also be used to break defensive distillation. We hope our attacks will be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to create neural networks that resist adversarial examples.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-5533-3","10.1109/SP.2017.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958570","","Neural networks;Robustness;Measurement;Speech recognition;Security;Malware;Resists","","4206","7","48","IEEE","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The guided filter is also a more generic concept beyond smoothing: It can transfer the structures of the guidance image to the filtering output, enabling new filtering applications like dehazing and guided feathering. Moreover, the guided filter naturally has a fast and nonapproximate linear time algorithm, regardless of the kernel size and the intensity range. Currently, it is one of the fastest edge-preserving filters.

The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google.

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories.

A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called /spl alpha/-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or /spl alpha/-agents, and virtual agents associated with /spl alpha/-agents called /spl beta/- and /spl gamma/-agents. We show that migration of flocks can be performed using a peer-to-peer network of agents, i.e., ""flocks need no leaders.""

Current state-of-the-art “general purpose” no reference (NR) IQA algorithms require knowledge about anticipated distortions in the form of training examples and corresponding human opinion scores. However we have recently derived a blind IQA model that only makes use of measurable deviations from statistical regularities observed in natural images, without training on human-rated distorted images, and, indeed without any exposure to distorted images. Thus, it is “completely blind.” The new IQA model, which we call the Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) is based on the construction of a “quality aware” collection of statistical features based on a simple and successful space domain natural scene statistic (NSS) model. These features are derived from a corpus of natural, undistorted images. Experimental results show that the new index delivers performance comparable to top performing NR IQA models that require training on large databases of human opinions of distorted images.

We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are fine-tuned jointly with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation. (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies. (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with image-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works. (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear combination of these concepts.","2380-7504","978-1-4673-8391-2","10.1109/ICCV.2015.425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410782","","Face;Feature extraction;Training;Face recognition;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Image recognition","","4086","13","35","IEEE","18 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moore","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada",IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,"6 Jan 2003","1981","26","1","17","32","Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the ""internally balanced"" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{\bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.1981.1102568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1102568","","Principal component analysis;Linear systems;Controllability;Observability;Reduced order systems;Kalman filters;Signal analysis;Equations;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition","","4075","3","32","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database.

Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low-resolution and high-resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low-resolution image patch can be applied with the high-resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high-resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs , reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution (SR) and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle SR with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2050625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466111","Face hallucination;image super-resolution (SR);nonnegative matrix factorization;sparse coding;sparse representation","Image resolution;Signal resolution;Dictionaries;Signal representations;Statistics;Compressed sensing;Computational efficiency;Image generation;Strontium;Noise robustness","","3998","54","34","IEEE","18 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of “naturalness” in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

"Cascade R-CNN: Delving Into High Quality Object Detection","Z. Cai; N.

An object detector, trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the challenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is widely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains independently of the baseline detector strength.

A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, the authors have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.796284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=796284","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Mammography;Cost function;Breast tissue;Cyclic redundancy check;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging","Breast;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","3955","133","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the last several years, efforts toward the standardization of these MGs have been made. In this sense, this paper presents the hierarchical control derived from ISA-95 and electrical dispatching standards to endow smartness and flexibility to MGs. The hierarchical control proposed consists of three levels: 1) The primary control is based on the droop method, including an output-impedance virtual loop; 2) the secondary control allows the restoration of the deviations produced by the primary control; and 3) the tertiary control manages the power flow between the MG and the external electrical distribution system.

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1017616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017616","","Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Iterative algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Data compression;Pattern recognition;Data mining;Data structures;Data analysis","","3939","39","50","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We offer an alternative explanation of the principles of its operation, so that the reasons for its excellent performance can be better understood. These principles are partial ordering by magnitude with a set partitioning sorting algorithm, ordered bit plane transmission, and exploitation of self-similarity across different scales of an image wavelet transform. Moreover, we present a new and different implementation based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT), which provides even better performance than our previously reported extension of EZW that surpassed the performance of the original EZW. The image coding results, calculated from actual file sizes and images reconstructed by the decoding algorithm, are either comparable to or surpass previous results obtained through much more sophisticated and computationally complex methods. In addition, the new coding and decoding procedures are extremely fast, and they can be made even faster, with only small loss in performance, by omitting entropy coding of the bit stream by the arithmetic code.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.499834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=499834","","Codecs;Image coding;Partitioning algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Decoding;Signal processing;Sorting;Wavelet transforms;Image reconstruction;Performance loss","","3934","249","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating overlapping during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often very sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing, surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection accuracy.

However, most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance, which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off, this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module, which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in SENet, we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we propose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction, which can be efficiently implemented via 1D convolution. Furthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of 1D convolution, determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. The proposed ECA module is both efficient and effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of ResNet50 are 80 vs. 24.37M and 4.7e-4 GFlops vs. 3.86 GFlops, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 2% in terms of Top-1 accuracy.

The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of thewake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a networkwith three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to displaywhat the associativememory has in mind.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796673","","","","3863","104","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

We also propose a method for decentralized information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller. The information flow can thus be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.834433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333200","","Vehicles;Communication system control;Network topology;Graph theory;Communication networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Matrix decomposition;Stability criteria;Robust control","","3857","3","32","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed.

Centre loss penalises the distance between deep features and their corresponding class centres in the Euclidean space to achieve intra-class compactness. SphereFace assumes that the linear transformation matrix in the last fully connected layer can be used as a representation of the class centres in the angular space and therefore penalises the angles between deep features and their corresponding weights in a multiplicative way. Recently, a popular line of research is to incorporate margins in well-established loss functions in order to maximise face class separability. In this paper, we propose an Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. The proposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to its exact correspondence to geodesic distance on a hypersphere. We present arguably the most extensive experimental evaluation against all recent state-of-the-art face recognition methods on ten face recognition benchmarks which includes a new large-scale image database with trillions of pairs and a large-scale video dataset. We show that ArcFace consistently outperforms the state of the art and can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead.

Using a small number of training images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo of the face can be reconstructed. In turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative model that can be used to render (or synthesize) images of the face under novel poses and illumination conditions. The pose space is then sampled and, for each pose, the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. Our recognition algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination cone. Test results show that the method performs almost without error, except on the most extreme lighting directions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.927464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927464","","Lighting;Face recognition;Image reconstruction;Testing;Humans;Shape;Rendering (computer graphics);Vectors;Image recognition;Performance evaluation","","3790","45","76","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog.

The well-known structural similarity index brings IQA from pixel- to structure-based stage. In this paper, a novel feature similarity (FSIM) index for full reference IQA is proposed based on the fact that human visual system (HVS) understands an image mainly according to its low-level features. Specifically, the phase congruency (PC), which is a dimensionless measure of the significance of a local structure, is used as the primary feature in FSIM. Considering that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast information does affect HVS' perception of image quality, the image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as the secondary feature in FSIM. PC and GM play complementary roles in characterizing the image local quality. After obtaining the local quality map, we use PC again as a weighting function to derive a single quality score. Extensive experiments performed on six benchmark IQA databases demonstrate that FSIM can achieve much higher consistency with the subjective evaluations than state-of-the-art IQA metrics.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2109730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705575","Gradient;image quality assessment (IQA);low-level feature;phase congruency (PC)","Measurement;Gabor filters;Indexes;Feature extraction;Visualization;Image color analysis","Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Theoretical;Reproducibility of Results;Visual Perception","3771","6","39","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The convective heat-transfer coefficient h between the substrate and the coolant was found to be the primary impediment to achieving low thermal resistance. For laminar flow in confined channels, h scales inversely with channel width, making microscopic channels desirable. The coolant viscosity determines the minimum practical channel width. The use of high-aspect ratio channels to increase surface area will, to an extent, further reduce thermal resistance. Based on these considerations, a new, very compact, water-cooled integral heat sink for silicon integrated circuits has been designed and tested. At a power density of 790 W/cm2, a maximum substrate temperature rise of 71°C above the input water temperature was measured, in good agreement with theory. By allowing such high power densities, the heat sink may greatly enhance the feasibility of ultrahigh-speed VLSI circuits.","1558-0563","","10.1109/EDL.1981.25367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1481851","","Heat sinks;Very large scale integration;Thermal resistance;Coolants;Surface resistance;Circuit testing;Temperature measurement;Liquid cooling;Resistance heating;Surface impedance","","3767","191","10","IEEE","9 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the “Squeeze-and-Excitation” (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets.

"Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring","P. W. Shor","AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA",Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science,"6 Aug 2002","1994","","","124","134","A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in computation time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.<>","","0-8186-6580-7","10.1109/SFCS.1994.365700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=365700","","Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Polynomials;Computational modeling;Physics computing;Computer simulation;Costs;Mechanical factors;Cryptography;Circuit simulation","","3646","34","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on a key observation-most local patches in outdoor haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior. Moreover, a high-quality depth map can also be obtained as a byproduct of haze removal.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567108","Dehaze;defog;image restoration;depth estimation.","Image color analysis;Image restoration;Atmospheric modeling;Channel estimation","","3631","34","20","IEEE","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This logical irreversibility is associated with physical irreversibility and requires a minimal heat generation, per machine cycle, typically of the order of kT for each irreversible function. This dissipation serves the purpose of standardizing signals and making them independent of their exact logical history. Two simple, but representative, models of bistable devices are subjected to a more detailed analysis of switching kinetics to yield the relationship between speed and energy dissipation, and to estimate the effects of errors induced by thermal fluctuations.","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.53.0183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392446","","","","3626","24","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

A review of the area of array processing is given. The focus is on parameter estimation methods, and many relevant problems are only briefly mentioned. We emphasize the relatively more recent subspace-based methods in relation to beamforming. The article consists of background material and of the basic problem formulation. Then we introduce spectral-based algorithmic solutions to the signal parameter estimation problem. We contrast these suboptimal solutions to parametric methods. Techniques derived from maximum likelihood principles as well as geometric arguments are covered. Later, a number of more specialized research topics are briefly reviewed.

This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research, while contributing to the field's understanding of software development processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber (1989), the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge (1977). Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker's (1988) proposed set of measurement principles. An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which managers may use these metrics for process improvement.<>","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.295895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=295895","","Programming;Information management;Software measurement;Engineering management;Application software;Information technology;Software development management;Technology management;Ontologies;Software engineering","","3598","12","50","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms—with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability—as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2371999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994333","Carrier-grade networks;dependability;flow-based networking;network hypervisor;network operating systems (NOSs);network virtualization;OpenFlow;programmable networks;programming languages;scalability;software-defined environments;software-defined networking (SDN)","Control systems;IP networks;Virtualization;Software  defined networking;Computer networks;Communication networks","","3523","15","581","IEEE","19 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inventing a codec architecture that can realize a significant portion of the great capacity promised by information theory is essential to a standout long-term position in highly competitive arenas like fixed and indoor wireless. Use (nT, nR) to express the number of antenna elements at the transmitter and receiver. An (n, n) analysis shows that despite the n received waves interfering randomly, capacity grows linearly with n and is enormous. With n = 8 at 1% outage and 21-dB average SNR at each receiving element, 42 b/s/Hz is achieved. The capacity is more than 40 times that of a (1, 1) system at the same total radiated transmitter power and bandwidth. Moreover, in some applications, n could be much larger than 8. In striving for significant fractions of such huge capacities, the question arises: Can one construct an (n, n) system whose capacity scales linearly with n, using as building blocks n separately coded one-dimensional (1-D) subsystems of equal capacity? With the aim of leveraging the already highly developed 1-D codec technology, this paper reports just such an invention. In this new architecture, signals are layered in space and time as suggested by a tight capacity bound.","1538-7305","","10.1002/bltj.2015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6770094","","","","3506","109","","","29 Apr 2014","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

The embedded code represents a sequence of binary decisions that distinguish an image from the ""null"" image. Using an embedded coding algorithm, an encoder can terminate the encoding at any point thereby allowing a target rate or target distortion metric to be met exactly. Also, given a bit stream, the decoder can cease decoding at any point in the bit stream and still produce exactly the same image that would have been encoded at the bit rate corresponding to the truncated bit stream. In addition to producing a fully embedded bit stream, the EZW consistently produces compression results that are competitive with virtually all known compression algorithms on standard test images. Yet this performance is achieved with a technique that requires absolutely no training, no pre-stored tables or codebooks, and requires no prior knowledge of the image source. The EZW algorithm is based on four key concepts: (1) a discrete wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition, (2) prediction of the absence of significant information across scales by exploiting the self-similarity inherent in images, (3) entropy-coded successive-approximation quantization, and (4) universal lossless data compression which is achieved via adaptive arithmetic coding.<>","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.258085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=258085","","Image coding;Wavelet coefficients;Streaming media;Decoding;Discrete wavelet transforms;Rate distortion theory;Bit rate;Compression algorithms;Testing;Quantization","","3497","252","35","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective topology control approach. We propose a novel distributed clustering approach for long-lived ad hoc sensor networks. Our proposed approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in O(1) iterations, incurs low message overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. We prove that, with appropriate bounds on node density and intracluster and intercluster transmission ranges, HEED can asymptotically almost surely guarantee connectivity of clustered networks.

"Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels","E. Arikan","Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"16 Jun 2009","2009","55","7","3051","3073"," A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity $I(W)$ of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) $W$. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of $N$ independent copies of a given B-DMC  $W$, a second set of $N$  binary-input channels $\{W_N^{(i)}:1\le i\le N\}$  such that, as $N$ becomes large, the fraction of indices  $i$ for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near $1$  approaches $I(W)$ and the fraction for which  $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near $0$  approaches $1-I(W)$. The polarized channels  $\{W_N^{(i)}\}$ are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate $1$ through those with capacity near  $1$ and at rate $0$ through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC $W$ with $I(W)> 0$ and any target rate $R ≪ I(W)$, there exists a sequence of polar codes $\{{\Fraktur {C}}_n;n\ge 1\}$  such that  ${\Fraktur {C}}_n$ has block-length $N=2^n$ , rate  $\ge R$, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as $P_{e}(N,R) \le O(N^{-{1\over 4}})$  independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity $O(N\log N)$ for each.

Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation.

The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed.

First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.831865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323134","","Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Performance analysis;Radial basis function networks;Stability;Computer architecture;Infrared imaging","","3367","3","48","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ML estimator is compared with several other proposed processors of similar form. Under certain conditions the ML estimator is shown to be identical to one proposed by Hannan and Thomson [10] and MacDonald and Schultheiss [21]. Qualitatively, the role of the prefilters is to accentuate the signal passed to the correlator at frequencies for which the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is highest and, simultaneously, to suppress the noise power. The same type of prefiltering is provided by the generalized Eckart filter, which maximizes the S/N ratio of the correlator output.

In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (which we call the ""NASNet search space"") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or ""cell"") on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, which we name a ""NASNet architecture"". We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, a NASNet found by our method achieves 2.4% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. Although the cell is not searched for directly on ImageNet, a NASNet constructed from the best cell achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7% top-1 and 96.2% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the image features learned from image classification are generically useful and can be transferred to other computer vision problems. On the task of object detection, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0% achieving 43.1% mAP on the COCO dataset.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8579005","","Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Computational modeling;Aerospace electronics;Convolution;Google;Search methods","","3318","9","71","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2876865","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672203,61375047,91746209); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB1000901); Anhui Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:170808J08); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8627998","Deep learning;neural network;object detection","Object detection;Deep learning;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Training;Neural networks","","3288","","230","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2091281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640675","Dimensionality reduction;domain adaptation;Hilbert space embedding of distributions;transfer learning","Kernel;Optimization;Manifolds;Hilbert space;Learning systems;Feature extraction;Noise measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Computer Simulation;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Transfer (Psychology)","3281","7","37","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mathematical equations that govern the distribution of organisms were first discovered and developed during the 1960s. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature. This motivates the application of biogeography to optimization problems. Just as the mathematics of biological genetics inspired the development of genetic algorithms (GAs), and the mathematics of biological neurons inspired the development of artificial neural networks, this paper considers the mathematics of biogeography as the basis for the development of a new field: biogeography-based optimization (BBO). We discuss natural biogeography and its mathematics, and then discuss how it can be used to solve optimization problems. We see that BBO has features in common with other biology-based optimization methods, such as GAs and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This makes BBO applicable to many of the same types of problems that GAs and PSO are used for, namely, high-dimension problems with multiple local optima. However, BBO also has some features that are unique among biology-based optimization methods. We demonstrate the performance of BBO on a set of 14 standard benchmarks and compare it with seven other biology-based optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate BBO on a real-world sensor selection problem for aircraft engine health estimation.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.919004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4475427","Biogeography;evolutionary algorithms;Kalman filter;optimization;sensor selection","Biogeography;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Biological systems;Equations;Organisms;Genetic algorithms;Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Particle swarm optimization","","3257","1","39","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, a source initiates transmission to its destination, and many relays potentially receive the transmission. Those terminals that can fully decode the transmission utilize a space-time code to cooperatively relay to the destination. We demonstrate that these protocols achieve full spatial diversity in the number of cooperating terminals, not just the number of decoding relays, and can be used effectively for higher spectral efficiencies than repetition-based schemes.

This problem of “doing things right” on a large scale is not essentially new; in a telephone central office, for example, a very large number of operations are performed while the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept well under control, though they have not been completely eliminated. This has been achieved, in part, through the use of self-checking circuits. The occasional failure that escapes routine checking is still detected by the customer and will, if it persists, result in customer complaint, while if it is transient it will produce only occasional wrong numbers. At the same time the rest of the central office functions satisfactorily. In a digital computer, on the other hand, a single failure usually means the complete failure, in the sense that if it is detected no more computing can be done until the failure is located and corrected, while if it escapes detection then it invalidates all subsequent operations of the machine. Put in other words, in a telephone central office there are a number of parallel paths which are more or less independent of each other; in a digital machine there is usually a single long path which passes through the same piece of equipment many, many times before the answer is obtained.","0005-8580","","10.1002/j.1538-7305.1950.tb00463.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772729","","","","3237","21","","","29 Apr 2014","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage, gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages, and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks in parallel. We conduct repeated multi-scale fusions such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over, leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result, the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset.

A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually “modernize” a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9879745","Deep learning architectures and techniques; Recognition: detection;categorization;retrieval; Representation learning","Computer vision;Image segmentation;Visualization;Computational modeling;Scalability;Semantics;Transformers","","3177","","92","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Image based benchmark datasets have driven development in computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking and segmentation of agents in the environment.

As machine learning based methods for detection and tracking become more prevalent, there is a need to train and evaluate such methods on datasets containing range sensor data along with images. In this work we present nuTonomy scenes (nuScenes), the first dataset to carry the full autonomous vehicle sensor suite: 6 cameras, 5 radars and 1 lidar, all with full 360 degree field of view. nuScenes comprises 1000 scenes, each 20s long and fully annotated with 3D bounding boxes for 23 classes and 8 attributes. It has 7x as many annotations and 100x as many images as the pioneering KITTI dataset. We define novel 3D detection and tracking metrics.

However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric. By incorporating this generalized IoU (GIoU) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, IoU based, and new, GIoU based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-3293-8","10.1109/CVPR.2019.00075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8953982","Recognition: Detection;Categorization;Retrieval;Deep Learning","","","3172","2","25","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781136","anomaly detection;outlier detection;novelty detection;isolation forest;binary trees;model based","Application software;Credit cards;Detectors;Constraint optimization;Data mining;Information technology;Laboratories;Isolation technology;Performance evaluation;Astronomy","","3169","15","14","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most popular are methods that assign each approximation set a vector of real numbers that reflect different aspects of the quality. Sometimes, pairs of approximation sets are also considered.

In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous attribute-based encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user's keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user's credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as role-based access control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223236","","Cryptography;Access control;Secure storage;Measurement;Personnel;File servers;Monitoring;Certification;Data security;Public key","","3121","223","31","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transport equation allowing for spatial variations is solved by first considering the homogeneous transport equation which omits electric fields. The homogeneous solution gives the purely diffusive motion of current carriers and involves large space charges. The electric field is then found, and approximate space charge neutrality is restored, by adding a particular solution of the transport equation in which the electric field is associated only with space charge but not with a current. The presence of point scatterers leads to a dipole field about each scatterer. The spatial average of a number of these dipole fields is the same as that obtained by the usual approach which does not explicitly consider the spatial variation. Infinite plane obstacles with a reflection coefficient r are also considered. These produce a resistance proportional to r/(1-r).","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.13.0223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392683","","","","3099","9","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The purpose of such schemes is to ensure that the rendered services are accessed only by a legitimate user and no one else. Examples of such applications include secure access to buildings, computer systems, laptops, cellular phones, and ATMs. In the absence of robust personal recognition schemes, these systems are vulnerable to the wiles of an impostor. Biometric recognition, or, simply, biometrics, refers to the automatic recognition of individuals based on their physiological and/or behavioral characteristics. By using biometrics, it is possible to confirm or establish an individual's identity based on ""who she is"", rather than by ""what she possesses"" (e.g., an ID card) or ""what she remembers"" (e.g., a password). We give a brief overview of the field of biometrics and summarize some of its advantages, disadvantages, strengths, limitations, and related privacy concerns.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2003.818349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262027","","Biometrics;Character recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Robustness;Privacy;Humans;Law enforcement;Databases;Computer science;Pattern recognition","","3057","126","34","IEEE","30 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pretraining and shows promising scaling behavior.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9879206","Representation learning; Self-& semi-& meta- & unsupervised learning","Training;Couplings;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data models;Pattern recognition","","3044","","72","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs.

They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations, they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand, discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts, but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work, we first outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results on standard domain adaptation tasks as well as a difficult cross-modality object classification task.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8099799","","Adaptation models;Gallium nitride;Training;Standards;Visualization;Image reconstruction","","3030","8","30","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method uses a ""primary"" input containing the corrupted signal and a ""reference"" input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the primary noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to obtain the signal estimate. Adaptive filtering before subtraction allows the treatment of inputs that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time variable. Wiener solutions are developed to describe asymptotic adaptive performance and output signal-to-noise ratio for stationary stochastic inputs, including single and multiple reference inputs. These solutions show that when the reference input is free of signal and certain other conditions are met noise in the primary input can be essentiany eliminated without signal distortion. It is further shown that in treating periodic interference the adaptive noise canceller acts as a notch filter with narrow bandwidth, infinite null, and the capability of tracking the exact frequency of the interference; in this case the canceller behaves as a linear, time-invariant system, with the adaptive filter converging on a dynamic rather than a static solution. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the usefulness of the adaptive noise cancelling technique in a variety of practical applications. These applications include the cancelling of various forms of periodic interference in electrocardiography, the cancelling of periodic interference in speech signals, and the cancelling of broad-band interference in the side-lobes of an antenna array. In further experiments it is shown that a sine wave and Gaussian noise can be separated by using a reference input that is a delayed version of the primary input. Suggested applications include the elimination of tape hum or turntable rumble during the playback of recorded broad-band signals and the automatic detection of very-low-level periodic signals masked by broad-band noise.","1558-2256","","10.1109/PROC.1975.10036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1451965","","Noise cancellation;Adaptive filters;Interference cancellation;Stochastic resonance;Additive noise;Signal to noise ratio;Distortion;Nonlinear filters;Bandwidth;Frequency","","3015","382","70","IEEE","28 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Image QA algorithms generally interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a ""reference"" or ""perfect"" image in some perceptual space. Such ""full-reference"" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of ""natural"" images and videos that are meant for ""human consumption."" Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations.

Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS's passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2936025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8811733","Intelligent reflecting surface;joint active and passive beamforming;phase shift optimization","Array signal processing;Interference;Wireless communication;MIMO communication;Receivers;Phase shifters;Signal to noise ratio","","3002","","28","IEEE","23 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EP has rather slow convergence rates, however, on some function optimization problems. In the paper, a ""fast EP"" (FEP) is proposed which uses a Cauchy instead of Gaussian mutation as the primary search operator. The relationship between FEP and classical EP (CEP) is similar to that between fast simulated annealing and the classical version. Both analytical and empirical studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of FEP and CEP for different function optimization problems. The paper shows that FEP is very good at search in a large neighborhood while CEP is better at search in a small local neighborhood. For a suite of 23 benchmark problems, FEP performs much better than CEP for multimodal functions with many local minima while being comparable to CEP in performance for unimodal and multimodal functions with only a few local minima. The paper also shows the relationship between the search step size and the probability of finding a global optimum and thus explains why FEP performs better than CEP on some functions but not on others. In addition, the importance of the neighborhood size and its relationship to the probability of finding a near-optimum is investigated. Based on these analyses, an improved FEP (IFEP) is proposed and tested empirically. This technique mixes different search operators (mutations). The experimental results show that IFEP performs better than or as well as the better of FEP and CEP for most benchmark problems tested.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.771163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=771163","","Genetic programming;Genetic mutations;Testing;Australia;Computer science;Simulated annealing;Computational intelligence;Convergence;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation","","2977","1","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the well-known Kullback divergences, the new measures do not require the condition of absolute continuity to be satisfied by the probability distributions involved. More importantly, their close relationship with the variational distance and the probability of misclassification error are established in terms of bounds. These bounds are crucial in many applications of divergence measures. The measures are also well characterized by the properties of nonnegativity, finiteness, semiboundedness, and boundedness.<>","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.61115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=61115","","Entropy;Probability distribution;Upper bound;Pattern analysis;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Pattern recognition;Taxonomy;Genetics;Computer science","","2959","19","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by channel coding with expanded sets of multilevel/phase signals in a manner which increases free Euclidean distance. Soft maximum--likelihood (ML) decoding using the Viterbi algorithm is assumed. Following a discussion of channel capacity, simple hand-designed trellis codes are presented for 8 phase-shift keying (PSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude-shift keying (QASK) modulation. These simple codes achieve coding gains in the order of 3-4 dB. It is then shown that the codes can be interpreted as binary convolutional codes with a mapping of coded bits into channel signals, which we call ""mapping by set partitioning."" Based on a new distance measure between binary code sequences which efficiently lower-bounds the Euclidean distance between the corresponding channel signal sequences, a search procedure for more powerful codes is developed. Codes with coding gains up to 6 dB are obtained for a variety of multilevel/phase modulation schemes. Simulation results are presented and an example of carrier-phase tracking is discussed.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.1982.1056454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1056454","","","","2958","336","14","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we pursue a ""true"" two-dimensional transform that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure that is key in visual information. The main challenge in exploring geometry in images comes from the discrete nature of the data. Thus, unlike other approaches, such as curvelets, that first develop a transform in the continuous domain and then discretize for sampled data, our approach starts with a discrete-domain construction and then studies its convergence to an expansion in the continuous domain. Specifically, we construct a discrete-domain multiresolution and multidirection expansion using nonseparable filter banks, in much the same way that wavelets were derived from filter banks. This construction results in a flexible multiresolution, local, and directional image expansion using contour segments, and, thus, it is named the contourlet transform. The discrete contourlet transform has a fast iterated filter bank algorithm that requires an order N operations for N-pixel images. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between the developed filter bank and the associated continuous-domain contourlet expansion via a directional multiresolution analysis framework. We show that with parabolic scaling and sufficient directional vanishing moments, contourlets achieve the optimal approximation rate for piecewise smooth functions with discontinuities along twice continuously differentiable curves. Finally, we show some numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of contourlets in several image processing applications.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.859376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532309","Contourlets;contours;filter banks;geometric image processing;multidirection;multiresolution;sparse representation;wavelets","Image resolution;Image representation;Discrete transforms;Filter bank;Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Geometry;Wavelet transforms;Discrete Fourier transforms;Convergence","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2946","8","41","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the success of DE in solving a specific problem crucially depends on appropriately choosing trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values. Employing a trial-and-error scheme to search for the most suitable strategy and its associated parameter settings requires high computational costs. Moreover, at different stages of evolution, different strategies coupled with different parameter settings may be required in order to achieve the best performance. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive DE (SaDE) algorithm, in which both trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values are gradually self-adapted by learning from their previous experiences in generating promising solutions. Consequently, a more suitable generation strategy along with its parameter settings can be determined adaptively to match different phases of the search process/evolution. The performance of the SaDE algorithm is extensively evaluated (using codes available from P. N. Suganthan) on a suite of 26 bound-constrained numerical optimization problems and compares favorably with the conventional DE and several state-of-the-art parameter adaptive DE variants.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.927706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632146","Differential evolution (DE);global numerical optimization;parameter adaptation;self-adaptation;strategy adaptation","Feedback;Stochastic processes;Computational efficiency;Power engineering and energy;Encoding;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Mechanical engineering;Pattern recognition;Size control","","2938","","42","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These 5G drawbacks are spurring worldwide activities focused on defining the next-generation 6G wireless system that can truly integrate far-reaching applications ranging from autonomous systems to extended reality. Despite recent 6G initiatives (one example is the 6Genesis project in Finland), the fundamental architectural and performance components of 6G remain largely undefined. In this article, we present a holistic, forward-looking vision that defines the tenets of a 6G system. We opine that 6G will not be a mere exploration of more spectrum at high-frequency bands, but it will rather be a convergence of upcoming technological trends driven by exciting, underlying services. In this regard, we first identify the primary drivers of 6G systems, in terms of applications and accompanying technological trends. Then, we propose a new set of service classes and expose their target 6G performance requirements. We then identify the enabling technologies for the introduced 6G services and outline a comprehensive research agenda that leverages those technologies. We conclude by providing concrete recommendations for the roadmap toward 6G. Ultimately, the intent of this article is to serve as a basis for stimulating more out-of-the-box research around 6G.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.001.1900287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869705","","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Market research;Wireless communication;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","","2935","","15","IEEE","16 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper presents a new external force for active contours, largely solving both problems. This external force, which we call gradient vector flow (GVF), is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image. It differs fundamentally from traditional snake external forces in that it cannot be written as the negative gradient of a potential function, and the corresponding snake is formulated directly from a force balance condition rather than a variational formulation. Using several two-dimensional (2-D) examples and one three-dimensional (3-D) example, we show that GVF has a large capture range and is able to move snakes into boundary concavities.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.661186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=661186","","Shape;Active contours;Image edge detection;Deformable models;Image segmentation;Computer vision;Image processing;Application software;Convergence;Two dimensional displays","","2928","37","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It uses a pixelwise, mutual information (Ml)-based matching cost for compensating radiometric differences of input images. Pixelwise matching is supported by a smoothness constraint that is usually expressed as a global cost function. SGM performs a fast approximation by pathwise optimizations from all directions. The discussion also addresses occlusion detection, subpixel refinement, and multibaseline matching. Additionally, postprocessing steps for removing outliers, recovering from specific problems of structured environments, and the interpolation of gaps are presented. Finally, strategies for processing almost arbitrarily large images and fusion of disparity images using orthographic projection are proposed. A comparison on standard stereo images shows that SGM is among the currently top-ranked algorithms and is best, if subpixel accuracy is considered. The complexity is linear to the number of pixels and disparity range, which results in a runtime of just 1-2 seconds on typical test images. An in depth evaluation of the Ml-based matching cost demonstrates a tolerance against a wide range of radiometric transformations. Finally, examples of reconstructions from huge aerial frame and pushbroom images demonstrate that the presented ideas are working well on practical problems.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359315","stereo;mutual information;global optimization;multi-baseline;stereo;mutual information;global optimization;multi-baseline","Mutual information;Stereo vision;Radiometry;Cost function;Computational efficiency;Pixel;Interpolation;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;Runtime","","2927","47","27","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al. . The results show that our method is significantly better than the two rule-based methods (p<0.01).

However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.","2380-7504","978-1-5386-1032-9","10.1109/ICCV.2017.167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8237429","","Training;Optimization;Neural networks;Gallium nitride;Real-time systems;Histograms;Interpolation","","2908","","55","IEEE","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.","1558-1284","","10.1109/MASSP.1986.1165342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1165342","","Hidden Markov models;Linear systems;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Mathematical model;Optimization methods;Pattern matching;Time varying systems;Fluctuations","","2894","108","15","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The Joint Video Team of the ITU-T VCEG and the ISO/IEC MPEG has now also standardized a Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of the H.264/AVC standard. SVC enables the transmission and decoding of partial bit streams to provide video services with lower temporal or spatial resolutions or reduced fidelity while retaining a reconstruction quality that is high relative to the rate of the partial bit streams. Hence, SVC provides functionalities such as graceful degradation in lossy transmission environments as well as bit rate, format, and power adaptation. These functionalities provide enhancements to transmission and storage applications. SVC has achieved significant improvements in coding efficiency with an increased degree of supported scalability relative to the scalable profiles of prior video coding standards. This paper provides an overview of the basic concepts for extending H.264/AVC towards SVC. Moreover, the basic tools for providing temporal, spatial, and quality scalability are described in detail and experimentally analyzed regarding their efficiency and complexity.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317636","H.264/AVC;MPEG-4;Scalable Video Coding (SVC);standards;video","Video coding;Automatic voltage control;Static VAr compensators;Video compression;ISO standards;IEC standards;Streaming media;Scalability;Transform coding;Decoding","","2892","336","51","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an ""optimal"" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. For purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients.

MmWave systems must therefore leverage large antenna arrays, made possible by the decrease in wavelength, to combat pathloss with beamforming gain. Beamforming with multiple data streams, known as precoding, can be used to further improve mmWave spectral efficiency. Both beamforming and precoding are done digitally at baseband in traditional multi-antenna systems. The high cost and power consumption of mixed-signal devices in mmWave systems, however, make analog processing in the RF domain more attractive. This hardware limitation restricts the feasible set of precoders and combiners that can be applied by practical mmWave transceivers. In this paper, we consider transmit precoding and receiver combining in mmWave systems with large antenna arrays. We exploit the spatial structure of mmWave channels to formulate the precoding/combining problem as a sparse reconstruction problem. Using the principle of basis pursuit, we develop algorithms that accurately approximate optimal unconstrained precoders and combiners such that they can be implemented in low-cost RF hardware. We present numerical results on the performance of the proposed algorithms and show that they allow mmWave systems to approach their unconstrained performance limits, even when transceiver hardware constraints are considered.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2014.011714.130846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717211","Millimeter wave;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);antenna arrays;beamforming;precoding;cellular communication;sparsity;sparse reconstruction;basis pursuit;limited feedback","Radio frequency;Antenna arrays;Baseband;Vectors;MIMO;Approximation methods;Hardware","","2810","23","76","IEEE","21 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It seamlessly augments users' cognitive abilities via compute-intensive capabilities such as speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. By thus empowering mobile users, we could transform many areas of human activity. This article discusses the technical obstacles to these transformations and proposes a new architecture for overcoming them. In this architecture, a mobile user exploits virtual machine (VM) technology to rapidly instantiate customized service software on a nearby cloudlet and then uses that service over a wireless LAN; the mobile device typically functions as a thin client with respect to the service. A cloudlet is a trusted, resource-rich computer or cluster of computers that's well-connected to the Internet and available for use by nearby mobile devices. Our strategy of leveraging transiently customized proximate infrastructure as a mobile device moves with its user through the physical world is called cloudlet-based, resource-rich, mobile computing. Crisp interactive response, which is essential for seamless augmentation of human cognition, is easily achieved in this architecture because of the cloudlet's physical proximity and one-hop network latency. Using a cloudlet also simplifies the challenge of meeting the peak bandwidth demand of multiple users interactively generating and receiving media such as high-definition video and high-resolution images. Rapid customization of infrastructure for diverse applications emerges as a critical requirement, and our results from a proof-of-concept prototype suggest that VM technology can indeed help meet this requirement.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2009.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280678","dynamic VM synthesis;cyber foraging;augmented reality;cognitive augmentation;virtual machines;resource constraints","Mobile computing;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Humans;Virtual manufacturing;Speech recognition;Natural language processing;Virtual machining;Wireless LAN;Internet","","2799","36","20","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The DE/current-to-pbest is a generalization of the classic ldquoDE/current-to-best,rdquo while the optional archive operation utilizes historical data to provide information of progress direction. Both operations diversify the population and improve the convergence performance. The parameter adaptation automatically updates the control parameters to appropriate values and avoids a user's prior knowledge of the relationship between the parameter settings and the characteristics of optimization problems. It is thus helpful to improve the robustness of the algorithm.

The objective of the field is to describe how the spectral content of a signal changes in time and to develop the physical and mathematical ideas needed to understand what a time-varying spectrum is. The basic gal is to devise a distribution that represents the energy or intensity of a signal simultaneously in time and frequency. Although the basic notions have been developing steadily over the last 40 years, there have recently been significant advances. This review is intended to be understandable to the nonspecialist with emphasis on the diversity of concepts and motivations that have gone into the formation of the field.<>","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.30749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=30749","","Time frequency analysis;Signal analysis;Speech analysis;Fourier transforms;Spectrogram;Signal resolution;Strips;Physics;Astronomy;Cities and towns","","2784","13","143","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Coordinate Attention for Efficient Mobile Network Design","Q. Hou; D. Zhou; J.

In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call ""coordinate attention"". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet classification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique.

Many datasets do not have common ground-truth object positions or extents, and this makes comparisons among the reported quantitative results difficult.

A system on chip (SoC) can provide an integrated solution to challenging design problems in the telecommunications, multimedia, and consumer electronics domains. Much of the progress in these fields hinges on the designers' ability to conceive complex electronic engines under strong time-to-market pressure. Success will require using appropriate design and process technologies, as well as interconnecting existing components reliably in a plug-and-play fashion. Focusing on using probabilistic metrics such as average values or variance to quantify design objectives such as performance and power will lead to a major change in SoC design methodologies. Overall, these designs will be based on both deterministic and stochastic models. Creating complex SoCs requires a modular, component-based approach to both hardware and software design. Despite numerous challenges, the authors believe that developers will solve the problems of designing SoC networks. At the same time, they believe that a layered micronetwork design methodology will likely be the only path to mastering the complexity of future SoC designs.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.976921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976921","","Network-on-a-chip;System-on-a-chip;Design methodology;Telecommunication network reliability;Multimedia systems;Consumer electronics;Fasteners;Engines;Time to market;Process design","","2728","59","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Given a set of data samples (vectors) approximately drawn from a union of multiple subspaces, our goal is to cluster the samples into their respective subspaces and remove possible outliers as well. To this end, we propose a novel objective function named Low-Rank Representation (LRR), which seeks the lowest rank representation among all the candidates that can represent the data samples as linear combinations of the bases in a given dictionary. It is shown that the convex program associated with LRR solves the subspace clustering problem in the following sense: When the data is clean, we prove that LRR exactly recovers the true subspace structures; when the data are contaminated by outliers, we prove that under certain conditions LRR can exactly recover the row space of the original data and detect the outlier as well; for data corrupted by arbitrary sparse errors, LRR can also approximately recover the row space with theoretical guarantees. Since the subspace membership is provably determined by the row space, these further imply that LRR can perform robust subspace clustering and error correction in an efficient and effective way.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6180173","Low-rank representation;subspace clustering;segmentation;outlier detection","Robustness;Noise;Dictionaries;Optimization;Polynomials;Data models;Vectors","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2724","2","51","IEEE","10 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test 2DPCA and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: ORL, AR, and Yale face databases.

A tightly coupled, nonlinear optimization-based method is used to obtain highly accurate visual-inertial odometry by fusing preintegrated IMU measurements and feature observations. A loop detection module, in combination with our tightly coupled formulation, enables relocalization with minimum computation.

The current and previous maps can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization.

In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in image SR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory (CM) mechanism. Local feature fusion in RDB is then used to adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilizes the training of wider network. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. Experiments on benchmark datasets with different degradation models show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578360","","Feature extraction;Convolution;Image resolution;Computer vision;Training;Buildings;Fuses","","2711","1","42","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are “doubly deep” in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal “layers”. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-6964-0","10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298878","","Visualization;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Data models;Logic gates;Image recognition;Microprocessors","","2702","81","48","IEEE","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common learning algorithm for radial basis function networks is based on first choosing randomly some data points as radial basis function centers and then using singular-value decomposition to solve for the weights of the network. Such a procedure has several drawbacks, and, in particular, an arbitrary selection of centers is clearly unsatisfactory. The authors propose an alternative learning procedure based on the orthogonal least-squares method. The procedure chooses radial basis function centers one by one in a rational way until an adequate network has been constructed. In the algorithm, each selected center maximizes the increment to the explained variance or energy of the desired output and does not suffer numerical ill-conditioning problems. The orthogonal least-squares learning strategy provides a simple and efficient means for fitting radial basis function networks. This is illustrated using examples taken from two different signal processing applications.<>","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.80341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=80341","","Least squares methods;Radial basis function networks;Neural networks;Signal processing algorithms;Multidimensional signal processing;Least squares approximation;Feedforward neural networks;Interpolation;Multidimensional systems;Singular value decomposition","","2669","8","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension. The CKF may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation of a square-root version of the CKF for improved numerical stability. The CKF is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variable.

SMAP will make global measurements of the soil moisture present at the Earth's land surface and will distinguish frozen from thawed land surfaces. Direct observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space will allow significantly improved estimates of water, energy, and carbon transfers between the land and the atmosphere. The accuracy of numerical models of the atmosphere used in weather prediction and climate projections are critically dependent on the correct characterization of these transfers. Soil moisture measurements are also directly applicable to flood assessment and drought monitoring. SMAP observations can help monitor these natural hazards, resulting in potentially great economic and social benefits. SMAP observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw timing will also reduce a major uncertainty in quantifying the global carbon balance by helping to resolve an apparent missing carbon sink on land over the boreal latitudes. The SMAP mission concept will utilize L-band radar and radiometer instruments sharing a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna to provide high-resolution and high-accuracy global maps of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state every two to three days. In addition, the SMAP project will use these observations with advanced modeling and data assimilation to provide deeper root-zone soil moisture and net ecosystem exchange of carbon.

To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578570","","Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Feature extraction;Shape;Proposals;Encoding","","2599","2","46","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A system which utilizes a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) STSA estimator is proposed and then compared with other widely used systems which are based on Wiener filtering and the ""spectral subtraction"" algorithm. In this paper we derive the MMSE STSA estimator, based on modeling speech and noise spectral components as statistically independent Gaussian random variables. We analyze the performance of the proposed STSA estimator and compare it with a STSA estimator derived from the Wiener estimator. We also examine the MMSE STSA estimator under uncertainty of signal presence in the noisy observations. In constructing the enhanced signal, the MMSE STSA estimator is combined with the complex exponential of the noisy phase. It is shown here that the latter is the MMSE estimator of the complex exponential of the original phase, which does not affect the STSA estimation. The proposed approach results in a significant reduction of the noise, and provides enhanced speech with colorless residual noise. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is approximately that of other systems in the discussed class.","0096-3518","","10.1109/TASSP.1984.1164453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1164453","","Speech enhancement;Amplitude estimation;Phase estimation;Noise reduction;Colored noise;Wiener filter;Filtering algorithms;Gaussian noise;Random variables;Independent component analysis","","2596","213","24","IEEE","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This leads to non-convex design optimization problems for which to tackle we propose two computationally affordable approaches, capitalizing on alternating maximization, gradient descent search, and sequential fractional programming. Specifically, one algorithm employs gradient descent for obtaining the RIS phase coefficients, and fractional programming for optimal transmit power allocation. Instead, the second algorithm employs sequential fractional programming for the optimization of the RIS phase shifts. In addition, a realistic power consumption model for RIS-based systems is presented, and the performance of the proposed methods is analyzed in a realistic outdoor environment.

This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the OverFeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the OverFeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the OverFeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or L2 distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks.","2160-7516","978-1-4799-4308-1","10.1109/CVPRW.2014.131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910029","","Feature extraction;Training;Birds;Visualization;Support vector machines;Vectors;Image recognition","","2583","17","52","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More tractable models have long been desirable. We develop new general models for the multi-cell signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using stochastic geometry. Under very general assumptions, the resulting expressions for the downlink SINR CCDF (equivalent to the coverage probability) involve quickly computable integrals, and in some practical special cases can be simplified to common integrals (e.g., the Q-function) or even to simple closed-form expressions. We also derive the mean rate, and then the coverage gain (and mean rate loss) from static frequency reuse. We compare our coverage predictions to the grid model and an actual base station deployment, and observe that the proposed model is pessimistic (a lower bound on coverage) whereas the grid model is optimistic, and that both are about equally accurate. In addition to being more tractable, the proposed model may better capture the increasingly opportunistic and dense placement of base stations in future networks.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042301","Cellular systems;outage probability;SINR;stochastic geometry","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Base stations;Fading channels;Mobile communication;Shadow mapping","","2579","3","34","IEEE","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout removes informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it suffers from information loss causing inefficiency in training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gain in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix can improve the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of distribution detection performance.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9008296","","Training;Task analysis;Object detection;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Dogs;Robustness","","2575","","51","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes gradient projection (GP) algorithms for the bound-constrained quadratic programming (BCQP) formulation of these problems. We test variants of this approach that select the line search parameters in different ways, including techniques based on the Barzilai-Borwein method. Computational experiments show that these GP approaches perform well in a wide range of applications, often being significantly faster (in terms of computation time) than competing methods.

In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency.

The Laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. In this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. Theoretical analysis shows that PCA, LDA, and LPP can be obtained from different graph models.

In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability.

The challenge in such multiuser systems is designing transmit vectors while considering the co-channel interference of other users. Typical optimization problems of interest include the capacity problem - maximizing the sum information rate subject to a power constraint-or the power control problem-minimizing transmitted power such that a certain quality-of-service metric for each user is met. Neither of these problems possess closed-form solutions for the general multiuser MIMO channel, but the imposition of certain constraints can lead to closed-form solutions. This paper presents two such constrained solutions. The first, referred to as ""block-diagonalization,"" is a generalization of channel inversion when there are multiple antennas at each receiver. It is easily adapted to optimize for either maximum transmission rate or minimum power and approaches the optimal solution at high SNR. The second, known as ""successive optimization,"" is an alternative method for solving the power minimization problem one user at a time, and it yields superior results in some (e.g., low SNR) situations. Both of these algorithms are limited to cases where the transmitter has more antennas than all receive antennas combined. In order to accommodate more general scenarios, we also propose a framework for coordinated transmitter-receiver processing that generalizes the two algorithms to cases involving more receive than transmit antennas. While the proposed algorithms are suboptimal, they lead to simpler transmitter and receiver structures and allow for a reasonable tradeoff between performance and complexity.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261332","","Downlink;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Closed-form solution;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Multiaccess communication;Wireless communication;Throughput;Interchannel interference","","2545","129","30","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system.

When the signal is absent, the decision statistic has a central chi-square distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to twice the time-bandwidth product of the input. When the signal is present, the decision statistic has a noncentral chi-square distribution with the same number of degrees of freedom and a noncentrality parameter λ equal to the ratio of signal energy to two-sided noise spectral density. Since the noncentral chi-square distribution has not been tabulated extensively enough for our purpose, an approximate form was used. This form replaces the noncentral chi-square with a modified chi-square whose degrees of freedom and threshold are determined by the noncentrality parameter and the previous degrees of freedom. Sets of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are drawn for several time-bandwidth products, as well as an extended nomogram of the chi-square cumulative probability which can be used for rapid calculation of false alarm and detection probabilities.

Allowing a node to encode its received data before passing it on, the question involves optimization of the multicast mechanisms at the nodes. Among the simplest coding schemes is linear coding, which regards a block of data as a vector over a certain base field and allows a node to apply a linear transformation to a vector before passing it on.

One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term ""SR image reconstruction"" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term ""super"" in ""super resolution"" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed.

Unlike the recently-proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-resolution outputs and incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including object detection, instance and semantic segmentation. For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP (see Figure 2).

However, most of the proposed solutions require distributed space-time coding algorithms, the careful design of which is left for future investigation if there is more than one cooperative relay. We propose a novel scheme that alleviates these problems and provides diversity gains on the order of the number of relays in the network. Our scheme first selects the best relay from a set of M available relays and then uses this ""best"" relay for cooperation between the source and the destination. We develop and analyze a distributed method to select the best relay that requires no topology information and is based on local measurements of the instantaneous channel conditions. This method also requires no explicit communication among the relays.

For extended sites, the system will require multiple cameras. Thus, key elements of the system are motion tracking, camera coordination, activity classification, and event detection. In this paper, we focus on motion tracking and show how one can use observed motion to learn patterns of activity in a site. Motion segmentation is based on an adaptive background subtraction method that models each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and uses an online approximation to update the model. The Gaussian distributions are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. This yields a stable, real-time outdoor tracker that reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. While a tracking system is unaware of the identity of any object it tracks, the identity remains the same for the entire tracking sequence. Our system leverages this information by accumulating joint co-occurrences of the representations within a sequence. These joint co-occurrence statistics are then used to create a hierarchical binary-tree classification of the representations. This method is useful for classifying sequences, as well as individual instances of activities in a site.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.868677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868677","","Tracking;Cameras;Monitoring;Event detection;Motion segmentation;Computer vision;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian distribution;Layout;Statistics","","2491","181","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, according to Shannon's rate distortion theory, the wavelet coefficients are vector quantized using a multiresolution codebook. To encode the wavelet coefficients, a noise shaping bit allocation procedure which assumes that details at high resolution are less visible to the human eye is proposed.

However, running computationally demanding applications at the TIEs is constrained by limited battery capacity and energy consumption of the TIEs. A suitable solution extending the battery life-time of the TIEs is to offload the applications demanding huge processing to a conventional centralized cloud. Nevertheless, this option introduces significant execution delay consisting of delivery of the off loaded applications to the cloud and back plus time of the computation at the cloud. Such a delay is inconvenient and makes the offloading unsuitable for real-time applications. To cope with the delay problem, a new emerging concept, known as mobile edge computing (MEC), has been introduced. The MEC brings computation and storage resources to the edge of mobile network enabling it to run the highly demanding applications at the TIE while meeting strict delay requirements. The MEC computing resources can be exploited also by operators and third parties for specific purposes. In this paper, we first describe major use cases and reference scenarios where the MEC is applicable. After that we survey existing concepts integrating MEC functionalities to the mobile networks and discuss current advancement in standardization of the MEC. The core of this survey is, then, focused on user-oriented use case in the MEC, i.e., computation offloading. In this regard, we divide the research on computation offloading to three key areas: 1) decision on computation offloading; 2) allocation of computing resource within the MEC; and 3) mobility management. Finally, we highlight lessons learned in area of the MEC and we discuss open research challenges yet to be addressed in order to fully enjoy potentials offered by the MEC.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2017.2682318","Czech Technical University in Prague(grant numbers:SGS17/184/OHK3/3T/13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879258","Mobile edge computing;mobile network architecture;computation offloading;allocation of computing resources;mobility management;standardization;use-cases","Mobile communication;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Mobile computing;Tutorials;Delays;Batteries","","2480","","124","IEEE","15 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.993206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993206","","Processor scheduling","","2465","7","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910578","","Error detection coding","","2455","123","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum.

We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set.

It provides a sufficient condition under which both OMP and Donoho's basis pursuit (BP) paradigm can recover the optimal representation of an exactly sparse signal. It leverages this theory to show that both OMP and BP succeed for every sparse input signal from a wide class of dictionaries. These quasi-incoherent dictionaries offer a natural generalization of incoherent dictionaries, and the cumulative coherence function is introduced to quantify the level of incoherence. This analysis unifies all the recent results on BP and extends them to OMP. Furthermore, the paper develops a sufficient condition under which OMP can identify atoms from an optimal approximation of a nonsparse signal. From there, it argues that OMP is an approximation algorithm for the sparse problem over a quasi-incoherent dictionary. That is, for every input signal, OMP calculates a sparse approximant whose error is only a small factor worse than the minimal error that can be attained with the same number of terms.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.834793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337101","","Approximation algorithms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Greedy algorithms;Sufficient conditions;Iterative algorithms;Approximation methods;Linear programming;Signal processing;Iterative methods","","2445","20","32","IEEE","27 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. However, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. To address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. Our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. In particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975165","Pedestrian detection;object detection;benchmark;evaluation;data set;Caltech Pedestrian data set.","Detectors;Pixel;Cameras;Training;Testing;Heating;Labeling","Automatic Data Processing;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity","2443","27","90","IEEE","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The array uses imperfect channel-state information derived from transmitted pilots to extract the individual data streams. The power radiated by the terminals can be made inversely proportional to the square-root of the number of base station antennas with no reduction in performance. In contrast if perfect channel-state information were available the power could be made inversely proportional to the number of antennas. Lower capacity bounds for maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection are derived. An MRC receiver normally performs worse than ZF and MMSE. However as power levels are reduced, the cross-talk introduced by the inferior maximum-ratio receiver eventually falls below the noise level and this simple receiver becomes a viable option. The tradeoff between the energy efficiency (as measured in bits/J) and spectral efficiency (as measured in bits/channel use/terminal) is quantified for a channel model that includes small-scale fading but not large-scale fading. It is shown that the use of moderately large antenna arrays can improve the spectral and energy efficiency with orders of magnitude compared to a single-antenna system.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2013.020413.110848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457363","Energy efficiency;spectral efficiency;multiuser MIMO;very large MIMO systems","Uplink;Fading;MIMO;Detectors;Arrays;Receivers;Vectors","","2438","36","23","IEEE","7 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network.

This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed “modes”) indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model.

In this paper, we consider the problem of encoding a point cloud into a format appropriate for a downstream detection pipeline. Recent literature suggests two types of encoders; fixed encoders tend to be fast but sacrifice accuracy, while encoders that are learned from data are more accurate, but slower. In this work, we propose PointPillars, a novel encoder which utilizes PointNets to learn a representation of point clouds organized in vertical columns (pillars). While the encoded features can be used with any standard 2D convolutional detection architecture, we further propose a lean downstream network. Extensive experimentation shows that PointPillars outperforms previous encoders with respect to both speed and accuracy by a large margin. Despite only using lidar, our full detection pipeline significantly outperforms the state of the art, even among fusion methods, with respect to both the 3D and bird’s eye view KITTI benchmarks. This detection performance is achieved while running at 62 Hz: a 2 - 4 fold runtime improvement. A faster version of our method matches the state of the art at 105 Hz.

The challenge is to fill in the hole that is left behind in a visually plausible way. In the past, this problem has been addressed by two classes of algorithms: 1) ""texture synthesis"" algorithms for generating large image regions from sample textures and 2) ""inpainting"" techniques for filling in small image gaps. The former has been demonstrated for ""textures""-repeating two-dimensional patterns with some stochasticity; the latter focus on linear ""structures"" which can be thought of as one-dimensional patterns, such as lines and object contours. This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm that combines the advantages of these two approaches. We first note that exemplar-based texture synthesis contains the essential process required to replicate both texture and structure; the success of structure propagation, however, is highly dependent on the order in which the filling proceeds. We propose a best-first algorithm in which the confidence in the synthesized pixel values is propagated in a manner similar to the propagation of information in inpainting. The actual color values are computed using exemplar-based synthesis. In this paper, the simultaneous propagation of texture and structure information is achieved by a single , efficient algorithm. Computational efficiency is achieved by a block-based sampling process. A number of examples on real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing large occluding objects, as well as thin scratches. Robustness with respect to the shape of the manually selected target region is also demonstrated. Our results compare favorably to those obtained by existing techniques.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.833105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323101","","Filling;Digital images;Image generation;Computational efficiency;Image sampling;Robustness;Shape;Humans;Two dimensional displays;Water resources","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Hypermedia;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Paintings;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","2400","76","27","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The point of this note is that fuzzy logic plays a pivotal role in CW and vice-versa. Thus, as an approximation, fuzzy logic may be equated to CW. There are two major imperatives for computing with words. First, computing with words is a necessity when the available information is too imprecise to justify the use of numbers, and second, when there is a tolerance for imprecision which can be exploited to achieve tractability, robustness, low solution cost, and better rapport with reality. Exploitation of the tolerance for imprecision is an issue of central importance in CW. In CW, a word is viewed as a label of a granule; that is, a fuzzy set of points drawn together by similarity, with the fuzzy set playing the role of a fuzzy constraint on a variable. The premises are assumed to be expressed as propositions in a natural language.

The oldest and simplest correlation filters use simple templates and generally fail when applied to tracking. More modern approaches such as ASEF and UMACE perform better, but their training needs are poorly suited to tracking. Visual tracking requires robust filters to be trained from a single frame and dynamically adapted as the appearance of the target object changes. This paper presents a new type of correlation filter, a Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) filter, which produces stable correlation filters when initialized using a single frame. A tracker based upon MOSSE filters is robust to variations in lighting, scale, pose, and nonrigid deformations while operating at 669 frames per second. Occlusion is detected based upon the peak-to-sidelobe ratio, which enables the tracker to pause and resume where it left off when the object reappears.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539960","","Adaptive filters;Target tracking;Robustness;Object detection;Resumes;Video sequences;Detectors;Cameras;Convolution","","2378","1","19","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains some of the attractive features of existing methods and overcomes some of their limitations. The authors' techniques can be applied to model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance of the authors' model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed by Osher and Sethian (1988) to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a ""Hamilton-Jacobi"" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying upwind finite difference schemes. The authors present a variety of ways of computing the evolving front, including narrow bands, reinitializations, and different stopping criteria. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on some synthesized images and some low contrast medical images.<>","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.368173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=368173","","Shape;Level set;Computer vision;Computer graphics;Topology;Solid modeling;Difference equations;Finite difference methods;Narrowband;Biomedical imaging","","2378","39","40","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a promising technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), is discussed, which can address some of these challenges for 5G. Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access technologies, NOMA can accommodate much more users via nonorthogonal resource allocation. We divide existing dominant NOMA schemes into two categories: power-domain multiplexing and code-domain multiplexing, and the corresponding schemes include power-domain NOMA, multiple access with low-density spreading, sparse code multiple access, multi-user shared access, pattern division multiple access, and so on. We discuss their principles, key features, and pros/cons, and then provide a comprehensive comparison of these solutions from the perspective of spectral efficiency, system performance, receiver complexity, and so on. In addition, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for NOMA design are highlighted to provide some insight on the potential future work for researchers in this field. Finally, to leverage different multiple access schemes including both conventional OMA and new NOMA, we propose the concept of software defined multiple access (SoDeMA), which enables adaptive configuration of available multiple access schemes to support diverse services and applications in future 5G networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7263349","","Multiplexing;Receivers;Silicon carbide;Uplink;Multiaccess communication;Interference;5G mobile communication","","2375","14","15","IEEE","16 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.878533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878533","","Global Positioning System;Timing;Time measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Mobile robots;Receivers;Instruments;Monitoring;Soil;Costs","","2374","47","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model.

To support this spectrum reuse functionality, the secondary users are required to sense the radio frequency environment, and once the primary users are found to be active, the secondary users are required to vacate the channel within a certain amount of time. Therefore, spectrum sensing is of significant importance in cognitive radio networks. There are two parameters associated with spectrum sensing: probability of detection and probability of false alarm. The higher the probability of detection, the better the primary users are protected. However, from the secondary users' perspective, the lower the probability of false alarm, the more chances the channel can be reused when it is available, thus the higher the achievable throughput for the secondary network. In this paper, we study the problem of designing the sensing duration to maximize the achievable throughput for the secondary network under the constraint that the primary users are sufficiently protected. We formulate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem mathematically, and use energy detection sensing scheme to prove that the formulated problem indeed has one optimal sensing time which yields the highest throughput for the secondary network. Cooperative sensing using multiple mini-slots or multiple secondary users are also studied using the methodology proposed in this paper. Computer simulations have shown that for a 6 MHz channel, when the frame duration is 100 ms, and the signal-to-noise ratio of primary user at the secondary receiver is -20 dB, the optimal sensing time achieving the highest throughput while maintaining 90% detection probability is 14.2 ms. This optimal sensing time decreases when distributed spectrum sensing is applied.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.060869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489760","","Cognitive radio;Throughput;FCC;Protection;Wireless sensor networks;TV;Radio frequency;Computer simulation;Receivers","","2372","13","20","IEEE","15 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, to efficiently control the local search and convergence to the global optimum solution, time-varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) are introduced in addition to the time-varying inertia weight factor in particle swarm optimization (PSO). From the basis of TVAC, two new strategies are discussed to improve the performance of the PSO. First, the concept of ""mutation"" is introduced to the particle swarm optimization along with TVAC (MPSO-TVAC), by adding a small perturbation to a randomly selected modulus of the velocity vector of a random particle by predefined probability. Second, we introduce a novel particle swarm concept ""self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with TVAC (HPSO-TVAC)"". Under this method, only the ""social"" part and the ""cognitive"" part of the particle swarm strategy are considered to estimate the new velocity of each particle and particles are reinitialized whenever they are stagnated in the search space. In addition, to overcome the difficulties of selecting an appropriate mutation step size for different problems, a time-varying mutation step size was introduced. Further, for most of the benchmarks, mutation probability is found to be insensitive to the performance of MPSO-TVAC method. On the other hand, the effect of reinitialization velocity on the performance of HPSO-TVAC method is also observed. Time-varying reinitialization step size is found to be an efficient parameter optimization strategy for HPSO-TVAC method. The HPSO-TVAC strategy outperformed all the methods considered in this investigation for most of the functions. Furthermore, it has also been observed that both the MPSO and HPSO strategies perform poorly when the acceleration coefficients are fixed at two.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.826071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304846","","Particle swarm optimization;Acceleration;Optimization methods;Genetic mutations;Manufacturing;Power engineering and energy;Automation;Automatic control;Personnel;Scholarships","","2371","16","40","IEEE","14 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed.

LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.","","0-7695-2102-9","10.1109/CGO.2004.1281665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281665","","Information analysis;Program processors;Performance analysis;High level languages;Virtual machining;Runtime;Arithmetic;Application software;Software safety;Algorithm design and analysis","","2324","33","44","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.176.0525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5391327","","","","2324","12","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long-range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2013.031813.120224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6489506","MIMO system;broadcast channel;precoding;wireless power;simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT);rate-energy tradeoff;energy harvesting","Wireless communication;Transmitters;MIMO;Wireless sensor networks;Switches;Receiving antennas","","2322","7","23","IEEE","28 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first system is a support vector machine-based system that uses the cosine kernel to estimate the similarity between the input data. The second system directly uses the cosine similarity as the final decision score. We tested three channel compensation techniques in the total variability space, which are within-class covariance normalization (WCCN), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), and nuisance attribute projection (NAP). We found that the best results are obtained when LDA is followed by WCCN.

Despite their success, these models have two limitations: (1) their optimal depth is apriori unknown, requiring extensive architecture search or inefficient ensemble of models of varying depths; and (2) their skip connections impose an unnecessarily restrictive fusion scheme, forcing aggregation only at the same-scale feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. To overcome these two limitations, we propose UNet++, a new neural architecture for semantic and instance segmentation, by (1) alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; (2) redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; and (3) devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++. We have evaluated UNet++ using six different medical image segmentation datasets, covering multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM), and demonstrating that (1) UNet++ consistently outperforms the baseline models for the task of semantic segmentation across different datasets and backbone architectures; (2) UNet++ enhances segmentation quality of varying-size objects-an improvement over the fixed-depth U-Net; (3) Mask RCNN++ (Mask R-CNN with UNet++ design) outperforms the original Mask R-CNN for the task of instance segmentation; and (4) pruned UNet++ models achieve significant speedup while showing only modest performance degradation.

Furthermore, the proposed method has the ability to track the MPP for the extreme environmental condition, e.g., large fluctuations of insolation and partial shading condition. The algorithm is simple and can be computed very rapidly; thus, its implementation using a low-cost microcontroller is possible. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, MATLAB simulations are carried out under very challenging conditions, namely step changes in irradiance, step changes in load, and partial shading of the PV array. Its performance is compared with the conventional Hill Climbing (HC) method. Finally, an experimental rig that comprises of a buck-boost converter fed by a custom-designed solar array simulator is set up to emulate the simulation. The soft- ware development is carried out in the Dspace 1104 environment using a TMS320F240 digital signal processor.

A general theoretical treatment of such systems shows that one may expect, besides a high energy product (BH)/sub max/, a reversible demagnetization curve (exchange-spring) and, in certain cases, an unusually high isotropic remanence ratio B/sub r//J/sub s/, while the required volume fraction of the hard phase may be very low, on the order of 10%. The technological realization of such materials is shown to be based on the principle that all phases involved must emerge from a common metastable matrix phase in order to be crystallographically coherent and consequently magnetically exchange coupled.<>","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.102931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=102931","","Magnetic materials;Permanent magnets;Soft magnetic materials;Saturation magnetization;Composite materials;Corrosion;Demagnetization;Remanence;Crystalline materials;Metastasis","","2305","15","15","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we present recent results from channel measurement campaigns and the development of advanced algorithms and a prototype, which clearly demonstrate that the mmWave band may indeed be a worthy candidate for next generation (5G) cellular systems. The results of channel measurements carried out in both the United States and Korea are summarized along with the actual free space propagation measurements in an anechoic chamber. Then a novel hybrid beamforming scheme and its link- and system-level simulation results are presented. Finally, recent results from our mmWave prototyping efforts along with indoor and outdoor test results are described to assert the feasibility of mmWave bands for cellular usage.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6736750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736750","","Array signal processing;Antenna arrays;Millimeter wave communication;Radio frequency;Prototypes;Propagation losses;Receiving antennas;Next generation networking","","2301","31","15","IEEE","12 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space.

For every individual infinite sequencexa quantity\rho(x)is defined, called the compressibility ofx, which is shown to be the asymptotically attainable lower bound on the compression ratio that can be achieved forxby any finite-state encoder. This is demonstrated by means of a constructive coding theorem and its converse that, apart from their asymptotic significance, also provide useful performance criteria for finite and practical data-compression tasks. The proposed concept of compressibility is also shown to play a role analogous to that of entropy in classical information theory where one deals with probabilistic ensembles of sequences rather than with individual sequences. While the definition of\rho(x)allows a different machine for each different sequence to be compressed, the constructive coding theorem leads to a universal algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for all sequences.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.1978.1055934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1055934","","","","2276","196","6","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Beyond the fact that adapting self-supervised methods to this architecture works particularly well, we make the following observations: first, self-supervised ViT features contain explicit information about the semantic segmentation of an image, which does not emerge as clearly with supervised ViTs, nor with convnets. Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder [26], multi-crop training [9], and the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between DINO and ViTs by achieving 80.1% top-1 on ImageNet in linear evaluation with ViT-Base.","2380-7504","978-1-6654-2812-5","10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709990","Representation learning;Recognition and classification;Transfer/Low-shot/Semi/Unsupervised Learning","Training;Image segmentation;Computer vision;Semantics;Layout;Image retrieval;Computer architecture","","2272","","69","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the fuzzy basis function representations, an orthogonal least-squares (OLS) learning algorithm is developed for designing fuzzy systems based on given input-output pairs; then, the OLS algorithm is used to select significant fuzzy basis functions which are used to construct the final fuzzy system.

LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second.

We focus on the stability analysis for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching, and we highlight necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. After a brief review of the stability analysis under restricted switching and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the switching stabilization problem is studied, and a variety of switching stabilization methods found in the literature are outlined. Then the switching stabilizability problem is investigated, that is under what condition it is possible to stabilize a switched system by properly designing switching control laws. Note that the switching stabilizability problem has been one of the most elusive problems in the switched systems literature.

This paper improves their performance by taking into account camera motion to correct them. To estimate camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be complementary. These matches are, then, used to robustly estimate a homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in general different from camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve the estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given the estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it. We also use this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This significantly improves motion-based descriptors, such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results on four challenging action datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50) significantly outperform the current state of the art.","2380-7504","978-1-4799-2840-8","10.1109/ICCV.2013.441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751553","","Trajectory;Cameras;Optical imaging;Adaptive optics;Vectors;Detectors;Feature extraction","","2252","14","43","IEEE","3 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions.

Imaging spectrometers are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher spectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis, which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in scenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial resolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering, spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus, accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a few materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of: the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember variability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated many models searching for robust, stable, tractable, and accurate unmixing algorithms. This paper presents an overview of unmixing methods from the time of Keshava and Mustard's unmixing tutorial to the present. Mixing models are first discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based, and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical problems and potential solutions are described.

The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports. As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association hypothesis using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received, the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively using all available information such as density of unknown targets, density of false targets, probability of detection, and location uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined. To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently.

In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach can reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the total energy demand, the total energy costs, as well as each user's individual daily electricity charges.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2010.2089069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628271","Demand-side management;distributed algorithms;energy consumption scheduling;energy pricing;game theory;market incentives;smart grid;smart meter","Energy consumption;Distributed algorithms;Peak to average power ratio;Smart grids;Cost function;Pricing;Game theory","","2234","3","31","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Let us say thatXtakes values in the finite set\cal X. It is desired to encode the sequence\{X_{k}\}in blocks of length n into a binary stream of rateR, which can in turn be decoded as a sequence\{ \hat{X}_{k} \}, where\hat{X}_{k} \in \hat{ \cal X}, the reproduction alphabet. The average distortion level is(1/n) \sum^{n}_{k=1} E[D(X_{k},\hat{X}_{k})], whereD(x,\hat{x}) \geq 0, x \in {\cal X}, \hat{x} \in \hat{ \cal X}, is a preassigned distortion measure. The special assumption made here is that the decoder has access to the side information\{Y_{k}\}. In this paper we determine the quantityR \ast (d), defined as the infimum ofratesRsuch that (with\varepsilon > 0arbitrarily small and with suitably largen)communication is possible in the above setting at an average distortion level (as defined above) not exceedingd + \varepsilon. The main result is thatR \ast (d) = \inf [I(X;Z) - I(Y;Z)], where the infimum is with respect to all auxiliary random variablesZ(which take values in a finite set\cal Z) that satisfy: i)Y,Zconditionally independent givenX; ii) there exists a functionf: {\cal Y} \times {\cal Z} \rightarrow \hat{ \cal X}, such thatE[D(X,f(Y,Z))] \leq d. LetR_{X | Y}(d)be the rate-distortion function which results when the encoder as well as the decoder has access to the side information\{ Y_{k} \}. In nearly all cases it is shown that whend > 0thenR \ast(d) > R_{X|Y} (d), so that knowledge of the side information at the encoder permits transmission of the\{X_{k}\}at a given distortion level using a smaller transmission rate. This is in contrast to the situation treated by Slepian and Wolf [5] where, for arbitrarily accurate reproduction of\{X_{k}\}, i.e.,d = \varepsilonfor any\varepsilon >0, knowledge of the side information at the encoder does not allow a reduction of the transmission rate.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.1976.1055508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1055508","","","","2232","33","7","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Often, such high-dimensional data lie close to low-dimensional structures corresponding to several classes or categories to which the data belong. In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, called sparse subspace clustering, to cluster data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among the infinitely many possible representations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparse representation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace. This motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used in a spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of the data into subspaces. Since solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, we consider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on the arrangement of the subspaces and the distribution of the data, the proposed minimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations. The proposed algorithm is efficient and can handle data points near the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal directly with data nuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries, by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimization program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic data as well as the two real-world problems of motion segmentation and face clustering.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2013.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482137","High-dimensional data;intrinsic low-dimensionality;subspaces;clustering;sparse representation;$(\ell_1)$-minimization;convex programming;spectral clustering;principal angles;motion segmentation;face clustering","Clustering algorithms;Noise;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Vectors;Computer vision;Face","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sample Size","2226","5","68","IEEE","19 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The batteries of these plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are to be charged at home from a standard outlet or on a corporate car park. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Without coordination of the charging, the vehicles are charged instantaneously when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore, coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charging profile of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is computed by minimizing the power losses. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed: quadratic and dynamic programming.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2036481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356176","Coordinated charging;distribution grid;dynamic programming;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;quadratic programming","Hybrid electric vehicles;Batteries;Power generation;Power quality;Voltage;Energy consumption;Dynamic programming;Delay;Load forecasting;Stochastic processes","","2226","7","19","IEEE","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.

This enables us to carry out probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.822821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263605","","Independent component analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Testing;Magnetic analysis;Gaussian noise;Signal analysis;Image analysis;Signal processing;Biomedical imaging;Noise reduction","Algorithms;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Neurons;Phantoms, Imaging;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Vision","2224","18","49","IEEE","6 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radio waves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks.

Existing methods use various constraints/priors to get plausible dehazing solutions. The key to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for an input hazy image. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end system called DehazeNet, for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazy image as input, and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequently used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNet adopts convolutional neural network-based deep architecture, whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image dehazing. Specifically, the layers of Maxout units are used for feature extraction, which can generate almost all haze-relevant features.

Over the years, many researchers have taken different approaches to the problem and have contributed significant research in this area and claim to have made progress in their respective domains. It is important to evaluate the performance of these algorithms in a comparative setting and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. In this paper, we present results of an extensive subjective quality assessment study in which a total of 779 distorted images were evaluated by about two dozen human subjects. The ""ground truth"" image quality data obtained from about 25 000 individual human quality judgments is used to evaluate the performance of several prominent full-reference image quality assessment algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, apart from video quality studies conducted by the Video Quality Experts Group, the study presented in this paper is the largest subjective image quality study in the literature in terms of number of images, distortion types, and number of human judgments per image. Moreover, we have made the data from the study freely available to the research community .

Utilized is the well-known probabilistic model of a two-class, discrete-measurement pattern environment (no Gaussian or statistical independence assumptions are made). The minimum-error recognition rule (Bayes) is used, with the unknown pattern environment probabilities estimated from the data relative frequencies. In calculating the mean accuracy over all such environments, only three parameters remain in the final equation:n, m, and the prior probabilityp_{c}of either of the pattern classes. With a fixed design pattern sample, recognition accuracy can first increase as the number of measurements made on a pattern increases, but decay with measurement complexity higher than some optimum value. Graphs of the mean accuracy exhibit both an optimal and a maximum acceptable value ofnfor fixedmandp_{c}. A four-place tabulation of the optimumnand maximum mean accuracy values is given for equally likely classes andmranging from2to1000. The penalty exacted for the generality of the analysis is the use of the mean accuracy itself as a recognizer optimality criterion.

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2535302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426826","Carotid intima-media thickness;computer-aided detection;convolutional neural networks;deep learning;fine-tuning;medical image analysis;polyp detection;pulmonary embolism detection;video quality assessment","Biomedical imaging;Training;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Computed tomography;Image analysis;Tuning","Colonic Polyps;Colonoscopy;Computed Tomography Angiography;Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Neural Networks (Computer);Pulmonary Embolism;ROC Curve","2200","16","76","IEEE","7 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Signal processing is critical for enabling the next generation of mmWave communication. Due to the use of large antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver, combined with radio frequency and mixed signal power constraints, new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication signal processing techniques are needed. Because of the wide bandwidths, low complexity transceiver algorithms become important. There are opportunities to exploit techniques like compressed sensing for channel estimation and beamforming.

However, many reported methods assume that the faces in an image or an image sequence have been identified and localized. To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.982883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982883","","Face detection;Face recognition;Human computer interaction;Facial features;Algorithm design and analysis;Shape;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Computer vision;Nose","","2196","294","181","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the convergence of the individual agents' states to a common value are presented, thereby extending recent results reported in the literature. The stability analysis is based upon a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools with the notion of convexity playing a central role. The analysis is integrated within a formal framework of set-valued Lyapunov theory, which may be of independent interest. Among others, it is observed that more communication does not necessarily lead to faster convergence and may eventually even lead to a loss of convergence, even for the simple models discussed in the present paper.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.841888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1393134","Multiagent systems;set-valued Lyapunov theory;stability analysis;swarms;synchronization","Multiagent systems;Convergence;Communication system control;Control systems;Oscillators;Stability analysis;Network topology;Physics;Equations;Distributed decision making","","2195","","45","IEEE","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we extend self-similarity based SR to overcome this drawback. We expand the internal patch search space by allowing geometric variations. We do so by explicitly localizing planes in the scene and using the detected perspective geometry to guide the patch search process. We also incorporate additional affine transformations to accommodate local shape variations. We propose a compositional model to simultaneously handle both types of transformations. We extensively evaluate the performance in both urban and natural scenes.

We show that it is NP-hard to compute a centralized optimal solution, and hence adopt a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading in a distributed manner. We formulate the distributed computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a multi-user computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game admits a Nash equilibrium and possesses the finite improvement property. We then design a distributed computation offloading algorithm that can achieve a Nash equilibrium, derive the upper bound of the convergence time, and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solutions in terms of two important performance metrics. We further extend our study to the scenario of multi-user computation offloading in the multi-channel wireless contention environment.

The issue of MPPT has been addressed in different ways in the literature but, especially for low-cost implementations, the perturb and observe (P&O) maximum power point tracking algorithm is the most commonly used method due to its ease of implementation. A drawback of P&O is that, at steady state, the operating point oscillates around the MPP giving rise to the waste of some amount of available energy; moreover, it is well known that the P&O algorithm can be confused during those time intervals characterized by rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In this paper it is shown that, in order to limit the negative effects associated to the above drawbacks, the P&O MPPT parameters must be customized to the dynamic behavior of the specific converter adopted.

Based on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear transformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could fully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed Ghost module can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing convolutional neural networks. Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack Ghost modules, and then the lightweight GhostNet can be easily established. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Ghost module is an impressive alternative of convolution layers in baseline models, and our GhostNet can achieve higher recognition performance (e.g. 75.7% top-1 accuracy) than MobileNetV3 with similar computational cost on the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 classification dataset.

This paper presents 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), a computer code which can accurately simulate the above problems. The 6S code is an improved version of 5S (Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), developed by the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique ten years ago. The new version now permits calculations of near-nadir (down-looking) aircraft observations, accounting for target elevation, non lambertian surface conditions, and new absorbing species (CH/sub 4/, N/sub 2/O, CO). The computational accuracy for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering effects has been improved by the use of state-of-the-art approximations and implementation of the successive order of scattering (SOS) algorithm. The step size (resolution) used for spectral integration has been improved to 2.5 nm. The goal of this paper is not to provide a complete description of the methods used as that information is detailed in the 6S manual, but rather to illustrate the impact of the improvements between 5S and 6S by examining some typical remote sensing situations. Nevertheless, the 6S code has still limitations. It cannot handle spherical atmosphere and as a result, it cannot be used for limb observations. In addition, the decoupling the authors are using for absorption and scattering effects does not allow to use the code in presence of strong absorption bands.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.581987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581987","","Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;Sea surface;Computational modeling;Rayleigh scattering;Remote sensing;Land surface;Infrared sensors;Atmosphere;Computer simulation","","2173","1","33","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multilevel voltage source converters typically synthesize the staircase voltage wave from several levels of DC capacitor voltages. One of the major limitations of the multilevel converters is the voltage unbalance between different levels. The techniques to balance the voltage between different levels normally involve voltage clamping or capacitor charge control. There are several ways of implementing voltage balance in multilevel converters. Without considering the traditional magnetic coupled converters, this paper presents three recently developed multilevel voltage source converters: (1) diode-clamp, (2) flying-capacitors, and (3) cascaded-inverters with separate DC sources. The operating principle, features, constraints, and potential applications of these converters are discussed.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.502161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=502161","","Capacitors;Diodes;Magnetic separation;Couplings;Clamps;Laboratories;Voltage control;Power industry;Leg;Switching converters","","2168","26","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moon","Utah State University, Logan, UT, US",IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,"6 Aug 2002","1996","13","6","47","60","A common task in signal processing is the estimation of the parameters of a probability distribution function. Perhaps the most frequently encountered estimation problem is the estimation of the mean of a signal in noise. In many parameter estimation problems the situation is more complicated because direct access to the data necessary to estimate the parameters is impossible, or some of the data are missing. Such difficulties arise when an outcome is a result of an accumulation of simpler outcomes, or when outcomes are clumped together, for example, in a binning or histogram operation. There may also be data dropouts or clustering in such a way that the number of underlying data points is unknown (censoring and/or truncation). The EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation. The EM algorithm is presented at a level suitable for signal processing practitioners who have had some exposure to estimation theory.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.543975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=543975","","Signal processing algorithms;Parameter estimation;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Phase detection;Convergence;Image reconstruction;Probability distribution;Histograms;Estimation theory","","2167","19","51","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The first issue is whether Web requests from a fixed user community are distributed according to Zipf's (1929) law. The second issue relates to a number of studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit certain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces. In particular, the question is whether these properties are inherent to Web accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facilitate both Web cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design. We show that the answers to the two questions are related. We first investigate the page request distribution seen by Web proxy caches using traces from a variety of sources. We find that the distribution does not follow Zipf's law precisely, but instead follows a Zipf-like distribution with the exponent varying from trace to trace. Furthermore, we find that there is only (i) a weak correlation between the access frequency of a Web page and its size and (ii) a weak correlation between access frequency and its rate of change. We then consider a simple model where the Web accesses are independent and the reference probability of the documents follows a Zipf-like distribution. We find that the model yields asymptotic behaviour that are consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the various observed properties of hit-ratios and temporal locality are indeed inherent to Web accesses observed by proxies. Finally, we revisit Web cache replacement algorithms and show that the algorithm that is suggested by this simple model performs best on real trace data. The results indicate that while page requests do indeed reveal short-term correlations and other structures, a simple model for an independent request stream following a Zipf-like distribution is sufficient to capture certain asymptotic properties observed at Web proxies.","0743-166X","0-7803-5417-6","10.1109/INFCOM.1999.749260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=749260","","Frequency;Web pages;Computer science;Web sites;Explosives;Internet","","2161","20","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. (By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate.) Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy.

First, the textures are modeled with volume local binary patterns (VLBP), which are an extension of the LBP operator widely used in ordinary texture analysis, combining motion and appearance. To make the approach computationally simple and easy to extend, only the co-occurrences of the local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) are then considered. A block-based method is also proposed to deal with specific dynamic events such as facial expressions in which local information and its spatial locations should also be taken into account. In experiments with two DT databases, DynTex and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both the VLBP and LBP-TOP clearly outperformed the earlier approaches.

A computation for color images that approaches fidelity to scene observation must combine dynamic range compression, color consistency-a computational analog for human vision color constancy-and color and lightness tonal rendition. In this paper, we extend a previously designed single-scale center/surround retinex to a multiscale version that achieves simultaneous dynamic range compression/color consistency/lightness rendition. This extension fails to produce good color rendition for a class of images that contain violations of the gray-world assumption implicit to the theoretical foundation of the retinex. Therefore, we define a method of color restoration that corrects for this deficiency at the cost of a modest dilution in color consistency. Extensive testing of the multiscale retinex with color restoration on several test scenes and over a hundred images did not reveal any pathological behaviour.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.597272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=597272","","Color;Layout;Humans;Analog computers;Computer vision;Dynamic range;Image coding;Image restoration;Testing;Visual perception","","2133","52","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further progress and realization of practical applications depends on systematic evaluations and comparisons of different brain signals, recording methods, processing algorithms, output formats, and operating protocols. However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BCI2000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300799","","Brain computer interfaces;Signal processing;Protocols;Laboratories;Communication system control;Control systems;Signal processing algorithms;Research and development;Biomedical signal processing;Biomedical engineering","Algorithms;Brain;Cognition;Communication Aids for Disabled;Computer Peripherals;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Evoked Potentials;Humans;Systems Integration;User-Computer Interface","2132","11","55","IEEE","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.","","0-7803-5800-7","10.1109/ASSPCC.2000.882463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882463","","Nonlinear systems;Random variables;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Filters;Sampling methods;Taylor series;Computational complexity;Performance gain;Machine learning;Neural networks","","2130","19","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = p·q such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A.

In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a subnetwork specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50%.

In this paper, the concept of deep learning is introduced into hyperspectral data classification for the first time. First, we verify the eligibility of stacked autoencoders by following classical spectral information-based classification. Second, a new way of classifying with spatial-dominated information is proposed. We then propose a novel deep learning framework to merge the two features, from which we can get the highest classification accuracy. The framework is a hybrid of principle component analysis (PCA), deep learning architecture, and logistic regression. Specifically, as a deep learning architecture, stacked autoencoders are aimed to get useful high-level features. Experimental results with widely-used hyperspectral data indicate that classifiers built in this deep learning-based framework provide competitive performance. In addition, the proposed joint spectral-spatial deep neural network opens a new window for future research, showcasing the deep learning-based methods' huge potential for accurate hyperspectral data classification.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2329330","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2013028); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61301206,61371180); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844831","Autoencoder (AE);deep learning;feature extraction;hyperspectral data classification;logistic regression;stacked autoencoder (SAE);support vector machine (SVM);Autoencoder (AE);deep learning;feature extraction;hyperspectral data classification;logistic regression;stacked autoencoder (SAE);support vector machine (SVM)","Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Training;Logistics;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis","","2107","","47","IEEE","26 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While we expect (and indeed, hope) that the MSE will continue to be widely used as a signal fidelity measure, it is our greater desire to see more advanced signal fidelity measures being used, especially in applications where perceptual criteria might be relevant. Ideally, the performance of a new signal processing algorithm might be compared to other algorithms using several fidelity criteria.

This diffraction coefficient remains valid in the transition regions adjacent to shadow and reflection boundaries, where the diffraction coefficients of Keller's original theory fail. Our method is based on Keller's method of the canonical problem, which in this case is the perfectly conducting wedge illuminated by plane, cylindrical, conical, and spherical waves. When the proper ray-fixed coordinate system is introduced, the dyadic diffraction coefficient for the wedge is found to be the sum of only two dyads, and it is shown that this is also true for the dyadic diffraction coefficients of higher order edges. One dyad contains the acoustic soft diffraction coefficient; the other dyad contains the acoustic hard diffraction coefficient. The expressions for the acoustic wedge diffraction coefficients contain Fresenel integrals, which ensure that the total field is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries. The diffraction coefficients have the same form for the different types of edge illumination; only the arguments of the Fresnel integrals are different. Since diffraction is a local phenomenon, and locally the curved edge structure is wedge shaped, this result is readily extended to the curved wedge. It is interesting that even though the polarizations and the wavefront curvatures of the incident, reflected, and diffracted waves are markedly different, the total field calculated from this high-frequency solution for the curved wedge is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries.","1558-2256","","10.1109/PROC.1974.9651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1451581","","Physical theory of diffraction;Acoustic diffraction;Electromagnetic diffraction;Fresnel reflection;Electromagnetic scattering;Surface waves;Electromagnetic reflection;Integral equations;Acoustic reflection;Lighting","","2104","11","44","IEEE","28 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spatial filters are implemented as a weighted sum of the data recorded at different sites. The weights are chosen to minimize the filter output power subject to a linear constraint. The linear constraint forces the filter to pass brain electrical activity from a specified location, while the power minimization attenuates activity originating at other locations. The estimated output power as a function of location is normalized by the estimated noise power as a function of location to obtain a neural activity index map. Locations of source activity correspond to maxima in the neural activity index map. The method does not require any prior assumptions about the number of active sources of their geometry because it exploits the spatial covariance of the source electrical activity. This paper presents a development and analysis of the method and explores its sensitivity to deviations between actual and assumed data models. The effect on the algorithm of covariance matrix estimation, correlation between sources, and choice of reference is discussed. Simulated and measured data is used to illustrate the efficacy of the approach.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.623056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=623056","","Brain;Filtering;Electrodes;Spatial filters;Magnetic heads;Nonlinear filters;Power generation;Geometry;Biomedical measurements;Solid modeling","Algorithms;Craniotomy;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Humans;Intraoperative Period;Linear Models;Models, Neurological;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2098","10","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Route construction should be done with a minimum of overhead and bandwidth consumption.

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework.

However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the networks may cause learning complicated and inefficient, and it may be difficult to train networks with nondifferential activation functions such as threshold networks. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this paper proves in an incremental constructive method that in order to let SLFNs work as universal approximators, one may simply randomly choose hidden nodes and then only need to adjust the output weights linking the hidden layer and the output layer. In such SLFNs implementations, the activation functions for additive nodes can be any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous functions $g:R\rightarrow R$ and the activation functions for RBF nodes can be any integrable piecewise continuous functions $g:R\rightarrow R$ and $\int_{R}g(x)dx\neq 0$. The proposed incremental method is efficient not only for SFLNs with continuous (including nondifferentiable) activation functions but also for SLFNs with piecewise continuous (such as threshold) activation functions. Compared to other popular methods such a new network is fully automatic and users need not intervene the learning process by manually tuning control parameters.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2006.875977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1650244","Ensemble;feedforward network;incremental extreme learning machine;radial basis function;random hidden nodes;support vector machine;threshold network;universal approximation","Support vector machines;Additives;Process control;Feedforward neural networks;Tuning","Algorithms;Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Statistics as Topic","2095","","53","IEEE","15 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432191","Registration;correspondence;matching;alignment;rigid;nonrigid;point sets;Coherent Point Drift (CPD);Gaussian mixture model (GMM);coherence;regularization;EM algorithm.","Stereo vision;Computational complexity;Computer vision;Coherence;Image registration;Shape;Image recognition;Feature extraction;Degradation;Biomedical imaging","","2084","24","49","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such environments, we propose the use of multiple transmit antennas to induce large and fast channel fluctuations so that multiuser diversity can still be exploited. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic beamforming and we show that true beamforming gains can be achieved when there are sufficient users, even though very limited channel feedback is needed.

The keys to the performance of the proposed algorithm are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints. Simple but effective methods are also proposed to turn the resulting patch model into a mesh which can be further refined by an algorithm that enforces both photometric consistency and regularization constraints. The proposed approach automatically detects and discards outliers and obstacles and does not require any initialization in the form of a visual hull, a bounding box, or valid depth ranges. We have tested our algorithm on various data sets including objects with fine surface details, deep concavities, and thin structures, outdoor scenes observed from a restricted set of viewpoints, and ""crowded"" scenes where moving obstacles appear in front of a static structure of interest.

In an application to computer vision, we show that our algorithms can reliably produce samples correctly classified by human subjects but misclassified in specific targets by a DNN with a 97% adversarial success rate while only modifying on average 4.02% of the input features per sample.

We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided.

The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes.

"A 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model for computing with words","F. Herrera; L.

However, there is a limitation of this approach imposed by its information representation model and the computation methods used when fusion processes are performed on linguistic values. This limitation is the loss of information; this loss of information implies a lack of precision in the final results from the fusion of linguistic information. In this paper, we present tools for overcoming this limitation. The linguistic information is expressed by means of 2-tuples, which are composed of a linguistic term and a numeric value assessed in (-0.5, 0.5). This model allows a continuous representation of the linguistic information on its domain, therefore, it can represent any counting of information obtained in a aggregation process. We then develop a computational technique for computing with words without any loss of information. Finally, different classical aggregation operators are extended to deal with the 2-tuple linguistic model.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.890332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=890332","","Information representation;Computational modeling;Decision making","","2071","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It optimizes for the energy efficiency of the entire system, including the accelerator chip and off-chip DRAM, for various CNN shapes by reconfiguring the architecture. CNNs are widely used in modern AI systems but also bring challenges on throughput and energy efficiency to the underlying hardware. This is because its computation requires a large amount of data, creating significant data movement from on-chip and off-chip that is more energy-consuming than computation. Minimizing data movement energy cost for any CNN shape, therefore, is the key to high throughput and energy efficiency. Eyeriss achieves these goals by using a proposed processing dataflow, called row stationary (RS), on a spatial architecture with 168 processing elements. RS dataflow reconfigures the computation mapping of a given shape, which optimizes energy efficiency by maximally reusing data locally to reduce expensive data movement, such as DRAM accesses. Compression and data gating are also applied to further improve energy efficiency. Eyeriss processes the convolutional layers at 35 frames/s and 0.0029 DRAM access/multiply and accumulation (MAC) for AlexNet at 278 mW (batch size N = 4), and 0.7 frames/s and 0.0035 DRAM access/MAC for VGG-16 at 236 mW (N = 3).","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2016.2616357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738524","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);dataflow processing;deep learning;energy-efficient accelerators;spatial architecture","Shape;Random access memory;Computer architecture;Throughput;Clocks;Neural networks;Hardware","","2070","","36","IEEE","8 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals.

The second main novelty is a multiple map system relying on a new place recognition method with improved recall that lets ORB-SLAM3 survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting them. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information from high parallax co-visible keyframes, even if they are widely separated in time or come from previous mapping sessions, boosting accuracy. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature and significantly more accurate.

The recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on iris phase structure encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. The combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 b/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. The high confidence levels are important because they allow very large databases to be searched exhaustively (one-to-many ""identification mode"") without making false matches, despite so many chances.

The criterion for equalizer adaptation is the minimization of a new class of nonconvex cost functions which are shown to characterize intersymbol interference independently of carrier phase and of the data symbol constellation used in the transmission system.

The dependency among the servers is described by the definition of their subsets that can be activated simultaneously. Multihop radio networks provide a motivation for the consideration of this system. The problem of scheduling the server activation under the constraints imposed by the dependency among servers is studied. The performance criterion of a scheduling policy is its throughput that is characterized by its stability region, that is, the set of vectors of arrival and service rates for which the system is stable. A policy is obtained which is optimal in the sense that its stability region is a superset of the stability region of every other scheduling policy, and this stability region is characterized. The behavior of the network is studied for arrival rates that lie outside the stability region.

The scheme is flexible in that different users may be given widely different performance guarantees and is efficient in that each of the servers is work conserving. The authors present a practical packet-by-packet service discipline, PGPS that closely approximates GPS. This allows them to relate results for GPS to the packet-by-packet scheme in a precise manner. The performance of a single-server GPS system is analyzed exactly from the standpoint of worst-case packet delay and burstiness when the sources are constrained by leaky buckets.

The threshold is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically within 5% of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising, and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically, the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly, especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern to denoising.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862633","","Image denoising;Image coding;Noise reduction;Quantization;Bayesian methods;Wavelet coefficients;Gaussian distribution;Image processing;Parameter estimation;Bit rate","","2045","44","36","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The process of consulting ""several experts"" before making a final decision is perhaps second nature to us; yet, the extensive benefits of such a process in automated decision making applications have only recently been discovered by computational intelligence community. Also known under various other names, such as multiple classifier systems, committee of classifiers, or mixture of experts, ensemble based systems have shown to produce favorable results compared to those of single-expert systems for a broad range of applications and under a variety of scenarios. Design, implementation and application of such systems are the main topics of this article. Specifically, this paper reviews conditions under which ensemble based systems may be more beneficial than their single classifier counterparts, algorithms for generating individual components of the ensemble systems, and various procedures through which the individual classifiers can be combined. We discuss popular ensemble based algorithms, such as bagging, boosting, AdaBoost, stacked generalization, and hierarchical mixture of experts; as well as commonly used combination rules, including algebraic combination of outputs, voting based techniques, behavior knowledge space, and decision templates.

The basic idea is to map a block of information bits to two information carrying units: 1) a symbol that was chosen from a constellation diagram and 2) a unique transmit antenna number that was chosen from a set of transmit antennas. The use of the transmit antenna number as an information-bearing unit increases the overall spectral efficiency by the base-two logarithm of the number of transmit antennas. At the receiver, a maximum receive ratio combining algorithm is used to retrieve the transmitted block of information bits. Here, we apply SM to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. We develop an analytical approach for symbol error ratio (SER) analysis of the SM algorithm in independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channels. The analytical and simulation results closely match. The performance and the receiver complexity of the SM–OFDM technique are compared to those of the vertical Bell Labs layered space–time (V-BLAST–OFDM) and Alamouti–OFDM algorithms. V-BLAST uses minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection with ordered successive interference cancellation. The combined effect of spatial correlation, mutual antenna coupling, and Rician fading on both coded and uncoded systems are presented. It is shown that, for the same spectral efficiency, SM results in a reduction of around 90% in receiver complexity as compared to V-BLAST and nearly the same receiver complexity as Alamouti. In addition, we show that SM achieves better performance in all studied channel conditions, as compared with other techniques. It is also shown to efficiently work for any configuration of transmit and receive antennas, even for the case of fewer receive antennas than transmit antennas.

To address this problem, efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behaviour have recently emerged. Moreover, an increasing number of efforts are reported toward multimodal fusion for human affect analysis including audiovisual fusion, linguistic and paralinguistic fusion, and multi-cue visual fusion based on facial expressions, head movements, and body gestures.

However, most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage. We propose a novel training objective that enables our convolutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex-ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity images by training our network with an image reconstruction loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone results in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency between the disparities produced relative to both the left and right images, leading to improved performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

We provide explicit relationships between the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio and the optical signal-to-noise ratio. We further evaluate the performance of modulation constellations such as quadrature-amplitude modulation, combinations of amplitude-shift keying and phase-shift keying, exotic constellations, and concentric rings for an additive white Gaussian noise channel using coherent detection. Part 2 is devoted specifically to the ""fiber channel.'' We review the physical phenomena present in transmission over optical fiber networks, including sources of noise, the need for optical filtering in optically-routed networks, and, most critically, the presence of fiber Kerr nonlinearity. We describe various transmission scenarios and impairment mitigation techniques, and define a fiber channel deemed to be the most relevant for communication over optically-routed networks. We proceed to evaluate a capacity limit estimate for this fiber channel using ring constellations. Several scenarios are considered, including uniform and optimized ring constellations, different fiber dispersion maps, and varying transmission distances.

These systems are unconventional in the sense that while they behave like resistive devices, they can be endowed with a rather exotic variety of dynamic characteristics. While possessing memory and exhibiting small-signal inductive or capacitive effects, they are incapable of energy discharge and they introduce no phase shift between the input and output waveforms. This zero-crossing property gives rise to a Lissajous figure which always passes through the origin. Memristive systems are hysteretic in the sense that their Lissajous figures vary with the excitation frequency. At very low frequencies, memristive systems are indistinguishable from nonlinear resistors while at extremely high frequencies, they reduce to linear resistors. These anomalous properties have misled and prevented the identification of many memristive devices and systems-including the thermistor, the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane circuit model, and the discharge tubes. Generic properties of memristive systems are derived and a canonic dynamical system model is presented along with an explicit algorithm for identifying the model parameters and functions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/PROC.1976.10092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1454361","","Memristors;Thermistors;Resistors;Equations;Voltage;Temperature;Hysteresis;Frequency;Biomembranes;VHF circuits","","2023","24","18","IEEE","28 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality, albeit with different quality of service (QoS), a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes, while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service.

The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide.

We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial ""machine learning as a service"" providers such as Google and Amazon.

It can embed more data than many of the existing reversible data hiding algorithms. It is proved analytically and shown experimentally that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the marked image generated by this method versus the original image is guaranteed to be above 48 dB. This lower bound of PSNR is much higher than that of all reversible data hiding techniques reported in the literature.

Explicitly enforcing the sparsity of the representation is motivated by a desire to obtain a sharp estimate of the spatial spectrum that exhibits super-resolution. We propose to use the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix to summarize multiple time or frequency samples. Our formulation leads to an optimization problem, which we solve efficiently in a second-order cone (SOC) programming framework by an interior point implementation.

The individual Gaussian components of a GMM are shown to represent some general speaker-dependent spectral shapes that are effective for modeling speaker identity. The focus of this work is on applications which require high identification rates using short utterance from unconstrained conversational speech and robustness to degradations produced by transmission over a telephone channel. A complete experimental evaluation of the Gaussian mixture speaker model is conducted on a 49 speaker, conversational telephone speech database. The experiments examine algorithmic issues (initialization, variance limiting, model order selection), spectral variability robustness techniques, large population performance, and comparisons to other speaker modeling techniques (uni-modal Gaussian, VQ codebook, tied Gaussian mixture, and radial basis functions). The Gaussian mixture speaker model attains 96.8% identification accuracy using 5 second clean speech utterances and 80.8% accuracy using 15 second telephone speech utterances with a 49 speaker population and is shown to outperform the other speaker modeling techniques on an identical 16 speaker telephone speech task.<>","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.365379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=365379","","Robustness;Telephony;Speech analysis;Speaker recognition;Spectral shape;Databases;Data mining;Loudspeakers;Degradation","","2004","135","42","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To realize sufficient link margin, mmWave systems will employ directional beamforming with large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost and power consumption of gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will likely be divided among the analog and digital domains. The large number of antennas and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of mmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper develops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters that exploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the efficient operation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is designed to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths. For single-path channels, an upper bound on the estimation error probability using the proposed algorithm is derived, and some insights into the efficient allocation of the training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are obtained. The adaptive channel estimation algorithm is then extended to the multi-path case relying on the sparse nature of the channel. Using the estimated channel, this paper proposes a new hybrid analog/digital precoding algorithm that overcomes the hardware constraints on the analog-only beamforming, and approaches the performance of digital solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity channel estimation algorithm achieves comparable precoding gains compared to exhaustive channel training algorithms. The results illustrate that the proposed channel estimation and precoding algorithms can approach the coverage probability achieved by perfect channel knowledge even in the presence of interference.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2334278","Huawei Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847111","Millimeter wave cellular systems;sparse channel estimation;adaptive compressed sensing;hybrid precoding","Vectors;Channel estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Array signal processing;Training;Radio frequency;Signal processing algorithms","","1996","28","41","IEEE","1 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

RISs can be realized in different ways, which include (i) large arrays of inexpensive antennas that are usually spaced half of the wavelength apart; and (ii) metamaterial-based planar or conformal large surfaces whose scattering elements have sizes and inter-distances much smaller than the wavelength. Compared with other transmission technologies, e.g., phased arrays, multi-antenna transmitters, and relays, RISs require the largest number of scattering elements, but each of them needs to be backed by the fewest and least costly components. Also, no power amplifiers are usually needed. For these reasons, RISs constitute a promising software-defined architecture that can be realized at reduced cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWaP design), and are regarded as an enabling technology for realizing the emerging concept of smart radio environments (SREs). In this paper, we (i) introduce the emerging research field of RIS-empowered SREs; (ii) overview the most suitable applications of RISs in wireless networks; (iii) present an electromagnetic-based communication-theoretic framework for analyzing and optimizing metamaterial-based RISs; (iv) provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research; and (v) discuss the most important research issues to tackle.

Using ultrasonic focused beams, it is possible to remotely generate mechanical vibration sources radiating low-frequency, shear waves inside tissues. Relying on this concept, SSI proposes to create such a source and make it move at a supersonic speed. In analogy with the ""sonic boom"" created by a supersonic aircraft, the resulting shear waves will interfere constructively along a Mach cone, creating two intense plane shear waves. These waves propagate through the medium and are progressively distorted by tissue heterogeneities. An ultrafast scanner prototype is able to both generate this supersonic source and image (5000 frames/s) the propagation of the resulting shear waves. Using inversion algorithms, the shear elasticity of medium can be mapped quantitatively from this propagation movie. The SSI enables tissue elasticity mapping in less than 20 ms, even in strongly viscous medium like breast. Modalities such as shear compounding are implementable by tilting shear waves in different directions and improving the elasticity estimation. Results validating SSI in heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The first in vivo investigations made on healthy volunteers emphasize the potential clinical applicability of SSI for breast cancer detection.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1295425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320804","","Biological tissues;Elasticity;Ultrasonic imaging;Visualization;Viscosity;Focusing;Vibrations;Aircraft manufacture;Prototypes;Motion pictures","Adult;Algorithms;Breast;Connective Tissue;Connective Tissue;Elasticity;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shear Strength;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Vibration","1988","66","16","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978225","Bagging;boosting;class distribution;classification;ensembles;imbalanced data-sets;multiple classifier systems","Learning systems;Accuracy;Training;Proposals;Noise;Algorithm design and analysis;Bagging","","1983","5","112","IEEE","8 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 and 73 GHz in New York, NY, USA, to derive detailed spatial statistical models of the channels and uses these models to provide a realistic assessment of mmW micro- and picocellular networks in a dense urban deployment. Statistical models are derived for key channel parameters, including the path loss, number of spatial clusters, angular dispersion, and outage. It is found that, even in highly non-line-of-sight environments, strong signals can be detected 100–200 m from potential cell sites, potentially with multiple clusters to support spatial multiplexing.

This paper surveys the fundamental capacity limits and associated transmission techniques for different wireless network design paradigms based on this promising technology. These paradigms are unified by the definition of a cognitive radio as an intelligent wireless communication device that exploits side information about its environment to improve spectrum utilization. This side information typically comprises knowledge about the activity, channels, codebooks, and/or messages of other nodes with which the cognitive node shares the spectrum. Based on the nature of the available side information as well as a priori rules about spectrum usage, cognitive radio systems seek to underlay, overlay, or interweave the cognitive radios' signals with the transmissions of noncognitive nodes. We provide a comprehensive summary of the known capacity characterizations in terms of upper and lower bounds for each of these three approaches. The increase in system degrees of freedom obtained through cognitive radios is also illuminated. This information-theoretic survey provides guidelines for the spectral efficiency gains possible through cognitive radios, as well as practical design ideas to mitigate the coexistence challenges in today's crowded spectrum.

We formulate this intuition as a non-parametric classification problem at the instance-level, and use noise-contrastive estimation to tackle the computational challenges imposed by the large number of instance classes.

Consequently, this approach has an obvious advantage when used in real-time digital image processing applications and where a parallel processor can be used. For both the additive and multiplicative cases, the a priori mean and variance of each pixel is derived from its local mean and variance. Then, the minimum mean-square error estimator in its simplest form is applied to obtain the noise filtering algorithms. For multiplicative noise a statistical optimal linear approximation is made.

The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low-power microcell or picocell base station.

Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links, and significant possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization, and receiver design.

Energy harvesting's true legacy dates to the water wheel and windmill, and credible approaches that scavenge energy from waste heat or vibration have been around for many decades. Nonetheless, the field has encountered renewed interest as low-power electronics, wireless standards, and miniaturization conspire to populate the world with sensor networks and mobile devices. This article presents a whirlwind survey through energy harvesting, spanning historic and current developments.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2005.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1401839","power harvesting;energy scavenging;parasitic power;human-powered systems;low-power electronics;ubiquitous computing sensors","Wireless sensor networks;Humans;Battery management systems;Energy management;Power system management;Design optimization;Voltage;Clocks;Analog-digital conversion;Renewable energy resources","","1958","41","29","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Two basic schemes are studied: the relays decode-and-forward the source message to the destination, or they compress-and-forward their channel outputs to the destination. The decode-and-forward scheme is a variant of multihopping, but in addition to having the relays successively decode the message, the transmitters cooperate and each receiver uses several or all of its past channel output blocks to decode. For the compress-and-forward scheme, the relays take advantage of the statistical dependence between their channel outputs and the destination's channel output. The strategies are applied to wireless channels, and it is shown that decode-and-forward achieves the ergodic capacity with phase fading if phase information is available only locally, and if the relays are near the source node. The ergodic capacity coincides with the rate of a distributed antenna array with full cooperation even though the transmitting antennas are not colocated. The capacity results generalize broadly, including to multiantenna transmission with Rayleigh fading, single-bounce fading, certain quasi-static fading problems, cases where partial channel knowledge is available at the transmitters, and cases where local user cooperation is permitted. The results further extend to multisource and multidestination networks such as multiaccess and broadcast relay channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.853304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1499041","Antenna arrays;capacity;coding;multiuser channels;relay channels","Decoding;Rayleigh channels;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Wireless sensor networks;Information theory;Digital relays;Antenna arrays;Broadcasting;Channel capacity","","1957","22","100","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The enhanced linewidth is attributed to the variation of the real refractive indexn'with carrier density. Spontaneous emission induces phase and intensity changes in the laser field. The restoration of the laser to its steady-state intensity results in changes in the imaginary part of the refractive index\Delta n"". These changes are accompanied by changes in the real part of the refractive index\Delta n', which cause additional phase fluctuations and line broadening.

DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart, represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude of a point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape, hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the classification of space as being part of the shapes interior or not. While classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes.

It can be shown that this transformation is equivalent to principal components transformations when the noise variance is the same in all bands and that it reduces to a multiple linear regression when noise is in one band only. Noise can be effectively removed from multispectral data by transforming to the MNF space, smoothing or rejecting the most noisy components, and then retransforming to the original space. In this way, more intense smoothing can be applied to the MNF components with high noise and low signal content than could be applied to each band of the original data. The MNF transformation requires knowledge of both the signal and noise covariance matrices. Except when the noise is in one band only, the noise covariance matrix needs to be estimated. One procedure for doing this is discussed and examples of cleaned images are presented.<>","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.3001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=3001","","Image quality;Image coding;Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Signal to noise ratio;Statistics;Australia;Aircraft;Linear regression;Covariance matrix","","1939","14","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods.

Our method does not require the bicubic interpolation as the pre-processing step and thus dramatically reduces the computational complexity. We train the proposed LapSRN with deep supervision using a robust Charbonnier loss function and achieve high-quality reconstruction. Furthermore, our network generates multi-scale predictions in one feed-forward pass through the progressive reconstruction, thereby facilitates resource-aware applications.

This stimulates the development of ""intelligent"" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and ""intelligent"" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree.

The method works by incrementally building two rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through, the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace. Some basic theoretical analysis is also presented.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844730","","Path planning;Computer science;Space exploration;Algorithm design and analysis;Humans;Animation;Robotic assembly;Buildings;Tree graphs;Kinematics","","1930","17","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications.","1558-1284","","10.1109/MASSP.1984.1162229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1162229","","Vector quantization;Data compression;Speech processing;Speech coding;Communication channels;Channel capacity;Phase change materials;Information theory","","1929","245","77","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery.

Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the earth mover distance measure for our t-closeness requirement.

We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable.

Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy.

Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput. Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.828953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306496","","Media Access Protocol;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Communication system traffic control;Wireless application protocol;Access protocols;Computer networks","","1920","16","24","IEEE","21 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added progressively. iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies quickly fail.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8100070","","Training;Training data;Prototypes;Feature extraction;Memory management;Classification algorithms;Computer vision","","1914","3","40","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 3$\times$3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. Our proposal was validated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2013 database (BRATS 2013), obtaining simultaneously the first position for the complete, core, and enhancing regions in Dice Similarity Coefficient metric (0.88, 0.83, 0.77) for the Challenge data set. Also, it obtained the overall first position by the online evaluation platform. We also participated in the on-site BRATS 2015 Challenge using the same model, obtaining the second place, with Dice Similarity Coefficient metric of 0.78, 0.65, and 0.75 for the complete, core, and enhancing regions, respectively.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2538465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426413","Brain tumor;brain tumor segmentation;convolutional neural networks;deep learning;glioma;magnetic resonance imaging","Tumors;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Kernel;Training;Brain modeling;Context","Brain Neoplasms;Glioma;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks (Computer)","1914","12","52","IEEE","4 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.938381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938381","","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Navigation;Uncertainty;Millimeter wave radar;Motion planning;Environmental management;Helium;Mechatronics","","1912","45","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to existing single-phase AC-link DC/DC converters, lower turn-off peak currents in the power devices and lower RMS current ratings for both the input and output filter capacitors are obtained.

In our concept, NOMA adopts a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver as the baseline receiver scheme for robust multiple access, considering the expected evolution of device processing capabilities in the future. Based on system-level evaluations, we show that the downlink NOMA with SIC improves both the capacity and cell-edge user throughput performance irrespective of the availability of the frequency-selective channel quality indicator (CQI) on the base station side. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions of NOMA by jointly applying multi-antenna/site technologies with a proposed NOMA/MIMO scheme using SIC and an interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver to achieve further capacity gains, e.g., a three-fold gain in the spectrum efficiency representing a challenging target for FRA.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-6337-2","10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6692652","","Silicon carbide;Receivers;OFDM;Throughput;Resource management;MIMO;Long Term Evolution","","1902","44","21","IEEE","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The encoder progressively reduces the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation, the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure transformer (i.e., without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR). Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and competitive results on Cityscapes.

In the presence of full knowledge of the underlying probabilities, Bayes decision theory gives optimal error rates. In those cases where this information is not present, many algorithms make use of distance or similarity among samples as a means of classification. The K-nearest neighbor decision rule has often been used in these pattern recognition problems. One of the difficulties that arises when utilizing this technique is that each of the labeled samples is given equal importance in deciding the class memberships of the pattern to be classified, regardless of their “typicalness.” The theory of fuzzy sets is introduced into the AT-nearest neighbor technique to develop a fuzzy version of the algorithm. Three methods of assigning fuzzy memberships to the labeled samples are proposed, and experimental results and comparisons to the crisp version are presented. In fact, not only does the fuzzy algorithm dominate its counterpart in terms of a lower error rate, the resulting memberships give a confidence measure of the classification. The fuzzy k-NN rule is also shown to compare well against other standard, more-sophisticated pattern recognition procedures in these experiments. A fuzzy analog of the nearest prototype algorithm is also developed.","2168-2909","","10.1109/TSMC.1985.6313426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6313426","","Support vector machine classification;Classification algorithms;Prototypes;Vectors;Iris;Error analysis;Pattern recognition","","1894","7","","IEEE","26 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Learning CNNs, however, amounts to estimating millions of parameters and requires a very large number of annotated image samples. This property currently prevents application of CNNs to problems with limited training data. In this work we show how image representations learned with CNNs on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. We design a method to reuse layers trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation for images in the PASCAL VOC dataset. We show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification, outperforming the current state of the art on Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets.

The mechanisms are canopy scatter from a cloud of randomly oriented dipoles, evenor double-bounce scatter from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different dielectric constants and Bragg scatter from a moderately rough surface. This composite scattering model is used to describe the polarimetric backscatter from naturally occurring scatterers. The model is shown to describe the behavior of polarimetric backscatter from tropical rain forests quite well by applying it to data from NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPLs) airborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) system. The model fit allows clear discrimination between flooded and nonflooded forest and between forested and deforested areas, for example. The model is also shown to be usable as a predictive tool to estimate the effects of forest inundation and disturbance on the fully polarimetric radar signature. An advantage of this model fit approach is that the scattering contributions from the three basic scattering mechanisms can be estimated for clusters of pixels in polarimetric SAR images. Furthermore, it is shown that the contributions of the three scattering mechanisms to the HH, HV, and VV backscatter can be calculated from the model fit. Finally, this model fit approach is justified as a simplification of more complicated scattering models, which require many inputs to solve the forward scattering problem.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.673687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=673687","","Radar scattering;Backscatter;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface fitting;Clouds;Dielectric constant;Rain;NASA;Propulsion","","1892","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both transmitter and receivers have perfect knowledge of the channel. Despite its apparent simplicity, this model is, in general, a nondegraded broadcast channel (BC), for which the capacity region is not fully known. For the two-user case, we find a special case of Marton's (1979) region that achieves optimal sum-rate (throughput). In brief, the transmitter decomposes the channel into two interference channels, where interference is caused by the other user signal. Users are successively encoded, such that encoding of the second user is based on the noncausal knowledge of the interference caused by the first user. The crosstalk parameters are optimized such that the overall throughput is maximum and, surprisingly, this is shown to be optimal over all possible strategies (not only with respect to Marton's achievable region). For the case of r>2 users, we find a somewhat simpler choice of Marton's region based on ordering and successively encoding the users. For each user i in the given ordering, the interference caused by users j>i is eliminated by zero forcing at the transmitter, while interference caused by users j<i is taken into account by coding for noncausally known interference. Under certain mild conditions, this scheme is found to be throughput-wise asymptotically optimal for both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We conclude by providing some numerical results for the ergodic throughput of the simplified zero-forcing scheme in independent Rayleigh fading.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.813523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207369","","Throughput;Broadcasting;Transmitters;Interference elimination;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Interference channels;Crosstalk;Signal to noise ratio;Rayleigh channels","","1884","89","57","IEEE","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the mutual information measures arbitrary dependencies between random variables, it is suitable for assessing the ""information content"" of features in complex classification tasks, where methods bases on linear relations (like the correlation) are prone to mistakes. The fact that the mutual information is independent of the coordinates chosen permits a robust estimation. Nonetheless, the use of the mutual information for tasks characterized by high input dimensionality requires suitable approximations because of the prohibitive demands on computation and samples. An algorithm is proposed that is based on a ""greedy"" selection of the features and that takes both the mutual information with respect to the output class and with respect to the already-selected features into account.

Compressive sensing is a framework whereby one does not measure one of the aforementioned N-dimensional signals directly, but rather a set of related measurements, with the new measurements a linear combination of the original underlying N-dimensional signal. The number of required compressive-sensing measurements is typically much smaller than N, offering the potential to simplify the sensing system. Let f denote the unknown underlying N-dimensional signal, and g a vector of compressive-sensing measurements, then one may approximate f accurately by utilizing knowledge of the (under-determined) linear relationship between f and g, in addition to knowledge of the fact that f is compressible in B. In this paper we employ a Bayesian formalism for estimating the underlying signal f based on compressive-sensing measurements g. The proposed framework has the following properties: i) in addition to estimating the underlying signal f, ""error bars"" are also estimated, these giving a measure of confidence in the inverted signal; ii) using knowledge of the error bars, a principled means is provided for determining when a sufficient number of compressive-sensing measurements have been performed; iii) this setting lends itself naturally to a framework whereby the compressive sensing measurements are optimized adaptively and hence not determined randomly; and iv) the framework accounts for additive noise in the compressive-sensing measurements and provides an estimate of the noise variance.

We derive approximations of achievable rates with several linear precoders and detectors which are proven to be asymptotically tight, but accurate for realistic system dimensions, as shown by simulations. It is known from previous work assuming uncorrelated channels, that as N→∞ while K is fixed, the system performance is limited by pilot contamination, the simplest precoders/detectors, i.e., eigenbeamforming (BF) and matched filter (MF), are optimal, and the transmit power can be made arbitrarily small. We analyze to which extent these conclusions hold in the more realistic setting where N is not extremely large compared to K. In particular, we derive how many antennas per UT are needed to achieve η% of the ultimate performance limit with infinitely many antennas and how many more antennas are needed with MF and BF to achieve the performance of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection and regularized zero-forcing (RZF), respectively.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2013.130205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415388","massive MIMO;time-division duplexing;channel estimation;pilot contamination;large system analysis;large random matrix theory;linear precoding;linear detection","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Vectors;Detectors;Antenna arrays;Uplink","","1880","12","27","IEEE","18 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerical examples are tabulated for periodically poled lithium niobate. Various types of errors in the periodicity of these structures are then analyzed to find their effects on the conversion efficiency and on the shape of the tuning curve. This analysis is useful for establishing fabrication tolerances for practical quasi-phase-matched devices.

While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples.

Several models have been considered including: (1) fixed base station assignment where the assignment of users to base stations is fixed, (2) minimum power assignment where a user is iteratively assigned to the base station at which its signal to interference ratio is highest, and (3) diversity reception where a user's signal is combined from several or perhaps all base stations. For the above models, the uplink power control problem can be reduced to finding a vector p of users' transmitter powers satisfying p/spl ges/I(p) where the jth constraint p/sub j//spl ges/I/sub j/(p) describes the interference that user j must overcome to achieve an acceptable connection. This work unifies results found for these systems by identifying common properties of the interference constraints. It is also shown that systems in which transmitter powers are subject to maximum power limitations share these common properties.

The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers.

The authors' method differs from previously known methods in that it uses local and global vessel features cooperatively to segment the vessel network. The authors evaluate their method using hand-labeled ground truth segmentations of 20 images. A plot of the operating characteristic shows that the authors' method reduces false positives by as much as 15 times over basic thresholding of a matched filter response (MFR), at up to a 75% true positive rate. For a baseline, they also compared the ground truth against a second hand-labeling, yielding a 90% true positive and a 4% false positive detection rate, on average. These numbers suggest there is still room for a 15% true positive rate improvement, with the same false positive rate, over the authors' method.

It is the purpose of this paper to show that the current due to generation and recombination of carriers from generation-recombination centers in the space charge region of a p-n junction accounts for the observed characteristics. This phenomenon dominates in semiconductors with large energy gap, low lifetimes, and low resistivity. This model not only accounts for the nonsaturable reverse current, but also predicts an apparent exp (qV/nkT) dependence of the forward current in a p-n junction. The relative importance of the diffusion current outside the space charge layer and the recombination current inside the space charge layer also explains the increase of the emitter efficiency of silicon transistors with emitter current. A correlation of the theory with experiment indicates that the energy level of the centers is a few kT from the intrinsic Fermi level.","2162-6634","","10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4056679","","P-n junctions;Character generation;Radiative recombination;Space charge;Current measurement;Current-voltage characteristics;Conductivity;Predictive models;Silicon;Energy states","","1862","25","29","IEEE","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, it explains the details of how 1/f noise in a device upconverts into close-in phase noise and identifies methods to suppress this upconversion.

Under this framework, the consensus of multiagent systems with a communication topology having a spanning tree can be cast into the stability of a set of matrices of the same low dimension. The notion of consensus region is then introduced and analyzed. It is shown that there exists an observer-type protocol solving the consensus problem and meanwhile yielding an unbounded consensus region if and only if each agent is both stabilizable and detectable. A multistep consensus protocol design procedure is further presented. The consensus with respect to a time-varying state and the robustness of the consensus protocol to external disturbances are finally discussed.

In this paper, we propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models, e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models on widely-used datasets, e.g., CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Further ablation studies and experimental results on representative computer vision tasks, i.e., object detection, class activation mapping, and salient object detection, further verify the superiority of the Res2Net over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned.

We show that the fading correlation affects the MEA capacity by modifying the distributions of the gains of these subchannels. The fading correlation depends on the physical parameters of MEA and the scatterer characteristics.

To meet the differing needs of many applications, the JPEG standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A DCT (discrete cosine transform)-based method is specified for 'lossy' compression, and a predictive method for 'lossless' compression. JPEG features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other DCT-based modes of operation.

Visualizing the prescribed performance characteristics as tracking error constraints, the key idea is to transform the ldquoconstrainedrdquo system into an equivalent ldquounconstrainedrdquo one, via an appropriately defined output error transformation. It is shown that stabilization of the ldquounconstrainedrdquo system is sufficient to solve the stated problem. Besides guaranteeing a uniform ultimate boundedness property for the transformed output error and the uniform boundedness for all other signals in the closed loop, the proposed robust adaptive controller is smooth with easily selected parameter values and successfully bypasses the loss of controllability issue.

Included in the discussion are the IEEE 802.11p amendment for wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), the IEEE 1609.2, 1609.3, and 1609.4 standards for Security, Network Services and Multi-Channel Operation, the SAE J2735 Message Set Dictionary, and the emerging SAE J2945.1 Communication Minimum Performance Requirements standard. The paper shows how these standards fit together to provide a comprehensive solution for DSRC. Most of the key standards are either recently published or expected to be completed in the coming year. A reader will gain a thorough understanding of DSRC technology for vehicular communication, including insights into why specific technical solutions are being adopted, and key challenges remaining for successful DSRC deployment. The U.S. Department of Transportation is planning to decide in 2013 whether to require DSRC equipment in new vehicles.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2132790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5888501","Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC);networks;safety;standards;vehicles;WAVE;5.9 GHz","Intelligent vehicles;IEEE 802.11 Standards;OFDM;Safety;Wireless communication;FCC","","1851","10","39","IEEE","16 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary goal is to reduce the switching frequency ripple at a reasonable cost, while at the same time achieving a high-performance front-end rectifier (as characterized by a rapid dynamic response and good stability margin). An example LCL filter design is reported and a filter has been built and tested using the values obtained from this design. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the design procedure both for the LCL filter and for the rectifier controller. The system is stable and the grid current harmonic content is low both in the lowand high-frequency ranges. Moreover, the good agreement that was obtained between simulation and experimental results validates the proposed approach. Hence, the design procedure and the simulation model provide a powerful tool to design an LCL-filter-based active rectifier while avoiding trial-and-error procedures that can result in having to build several filter prototypes.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2005.853373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510826","Cascade control;LCL filter;rectifier;stability;voltage-source converter (VSC)","Rectifiers;Power harmonic filters;Inductors;Electromagnetic interference;Switching frequency;Pulse width modulation;Converters;Power conversion;Stability;Voltage control","","1849","6","29","IEEE","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Characterization of Randomly Time-Variant Linear Channels","P. Bello","ADCOM, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Communications Systems,"6 Jan 2003","1963","11","4","360","393","This paper is concerned with various aspects of the characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels. At the outset it is demonstrated that time-varying linear channels (or filters) may be characterized in an interesting symmetrical manner in time and frequency variables by arranging system functions in (timefrequency) dual pairs. Following this a statistical characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels is carried out in terms of correlation functions for the various system functions. These results are specialized by considering three classes of practically interesting channels. These are the wide-sense stationary (WSS) channel, the uncorrelated scattering (US) channel, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel. The WSS and US channels are shown to be (time-frequency) duals. Previous discussions of channel correlation functions and their relationships have dealt exclusively with the WSSUS channel. The point of view presented here of dealing with the dually related system functions and starting with the unrestricted linear channels is considerably more general and places in proper perspective previous results on the WSSUS channel. Some attention is given to the problem of characterizing radio channels. A model called the Quasi-WSSUS channel is presented to model the behavior of such channels. All real-life channels and signals have an essentially finite number of degrees of freedom due to restrictions on time duration and bandwidth. This fact may be used to derive useful canonical channel models with the aid of sampling theorems and power series expansions. Several new canonical channel models are derived in this paper, some of which are dual to those of Kailath.","1558-2647","","10.1109/TCOM.1963.1088793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1088793","","Nonlinear filters;Time varying systems;Scattering;Time frequency analysis;Radar;Fourier transforms;Bandwidth;Sampling methods;Subcontracting;Delay","","1847","26","23","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Geometrically, A-Softmax loss can be viewed as imposing discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Moreover, the size of angular margin can be quantitatively adjusted by a parameter m. We further derive specific m to approximate the ideal feature criterion.

Even in single-target problems, this optimal filter is so computationally challenging that it must usually be approximated. Consequently, multitarget Bayes filtering will never be of practical interest without the development of drastic but principled approximation strategies. In single-target problems, the computationally fastest approximate filtering approach is the constant-gain Kalman filter. This filter propagates a first-order statistical moment - the posterior expectation - in the place of the posterior distribution. The purpose of this paper is to propose an analogous strategy for multitarget systems: propagation of a first-order statistical moment of the multitarget posterior. This moment, the probability hypothesis density (PHD), is the function whose integral in any region of state space is the expected number of targets in that region. We derive recursive Bayes filter equations for the PHD that account for multiple sensors, nonconstant probability of detection, Poisson false alarms, and appearance, spawning, and disappearance of targets. We also show that the PHD is a best-fit approximation of the multitarget posterior in an information-theoretic sense.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1261119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261119","","Filtering;Sensor systems;State-space methods;Virtual colonoscopy;Probability;Density measurement;Random number generation;Nonlinear filters;Terrorism;Contracts","","1842","3","70","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The APs and users have only one antenna each. The APs acquire channel state information through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink pilot signals transmitted by the users. The APs perform multiplexing/de-multiplexing through conjugate beamforming on the downlink and matched filtering on the uplink. Closed-form expressions for individual user uplink and downlink throughputs lead to max-min power control algorithms. Max-min power control ensures uniformly good service throughout the area of coverage. A pilot assignment algorithm helps to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, but power control is far more important in that regard. Cell-Free Massive MIMO has considerably improved performance with respect to a conventional small-cell scheme, whereby each user is served by a dedicated AP, in terms of both 95%-likely per-user throughput and immunity to shadow fading spatial correlation.

However, a systematic review of the literature concerning data sets and methods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all existing data sets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of scene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and diversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the development of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This paper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we propose a large-scale data set, termed “NWPU-RESISC45,” which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This data set contains 31 500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. The proposed NWPU-RESISC45 1) is large-scale on the scene classes and the total image number; 2) holds big variations in translation, spatial resolution, viewpoint, object pose, illumination, background, and occlusion; and 3) has high within-class diversity and between-class similarity.

Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.","2374-8486","978-1-4244-9131-5","10.1109/ICDM.2010.127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694074","factorization machine;sparse data;tensor factorization;support vector machine","Mathematical model;Support vector machines;Frequency modulation;Predictive models;Data models;Equations;Computational modeling","","1829","6","8","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry-represented as inverse depth in a reference frame-and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on essentially featureless walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2658577","ERC Consolidator; Google Faculty Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7898369","Visual odometry, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, structure from motion","Cameras;Geometry;Three-dimensional displays;Optimization;Robustness;Computational modeling;Visualization","","1829","","27","OAPA","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first review results for the Shannon capacity of fading channels with channel side information, where capacity is achieved using adaptive transmission techniques. We then derive the spectral efficiency of our proposed modulation. We show that there is a constant power gap between the spectral efficiency of our proposed technique and the channel capacity, and this gap is a simple function of the required bit-error rate (BER). In addition, using just five or six different signal constellations, we achieve within 1-2 dB of the maximum efficiency using unrestricted constellation sets. We compute the rate at which the transmitter needs to update its power and rate as a function of the channel Doppler frequency for these constellation sets. We also obtain the exact efficiency loss for smaller constellation sets, which may be required if the transmitter adaptation rate is constrained by hardware limitations. Our modulation scheme exhibits a 5-10-dB power gain relative to variable-power fixed-rate transmission, and up to 20 dB of gain relative to nonadaptive transmission. We also determine the effect of channel estimation error and delay on the BER performance of our adaptive scheme.

Stable feedback schemes obtainable from a given plant are parameterized. Salient properties of sensitivity reducing schemes are derived, and it is shown that plant uncertainty reduces the ability, of feedback to reduce sensitivity. The theory is developed for input-output systems in a general setting of Banach algebras, and then specialized to a class of multivariable, time-invariant systems characterized byn \times nmatrices ofH^{\infty}frequency response functions, either with or without zeros in the right half-plane. The approach is based on the use of a weighted seminorm on the algebra of operators to measure sensitivity, and on the concept of an approximate inverse. Approximate invertibility, of the plant is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for sensitivity reduction. An indicator of approximate invertibility, called a measure of singularity, is introduced. The measure of singularity of a linear time-invariant plant is shown to be determined by the location of its right half-plane zeros. In the absence of plant uncertainty, the sensitivity, to output disturbances can be reduced to an optimal value approaching the singularity, measure. In particular, if there are no right half-plane zeros, sensitivity can be made arbitrarily small. The feedback schemes used in the optimization of sensitivity resemble the lead-lag networks of classical control design. Some of their properties, and methods of constructing them in special cases are presented.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.1981.1102603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1102603","","Uncertainty;Algebra;Frequency;Output feedback;Filters;MIMO;Sufficient conditions;Design optimization;Control design;Additives","","1815","1","24","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The desired property is often one that is not normally found naturally (negative refractive index, near-zero index, etc.). Over the past ten years, metamaterials have moved from being simply a theoretical concept to a field with developed and marketed applications. Three-dimensional metamaterials can be extended by arranging electrically small scatterers or holes into a two-dimensional pattern at a surface or interface. This surface version of a metamaterial has been given the name metasurface (the term metafilm has also been employed for certain structures). For many applications, metasurfaces can be used in place of metamaterials. Metasurfaces have the advantage of taking up less physical space than do full three-dimensional metamaterial structures; consequently, metasurfaces offer the possibility of less-lossy structures. In this overview paper, we discuss the theoretical basis by which metasurfaces should be characterized, and discuss their various applications. We will see how metasurfaces are distinguished from conventional frequency-selective surfaces. Metasurfaces have a wide range of potential applications in electromagnetics (ranging from low microwave to optical frequencies), including: (1) controllable “smart” surfaces, (2) miniaturized cavity resonators, (3) novel wave-guiding structures, (4) angular-independent surfaces, (5) absorbers, (6) biomedical devices, (7) terahertz switches, and (8) fluid-tunable frequency-agile materials, to name only a few.

This article reviews some recent work on MIMO radar with widely separated antennas. Widely separated transmit/receive antennas capture the spatial diversity of the target's radar cross section (RCS). Unique features of MIMO radar are explained and illustrated by examples. It is shown that with noncoherent processing, a target's RCS spatial variations can be exploited to obtain a diversity gain for target detection and for estimation of various parameters, such as angle of arrival and Doppler.

However, these methods mostly learn a specific model for each noise level, and require multiple models for denoising images with different noise levels. They also lack flexibility to deal with spatially variant noise, limiting their applications in practical denoising. To address these issues, we present a fast and flexible denoising convolutional neural network, namely FFDNet, with a tunable noise level map as the input. The proposed FFDNet works on downsampled sub-images, achieving a good trade-off between inference speed and denoising performance. In contrast to the existing discriminative denoisers, FFDNet enjoys several desirable properties, including: 1) the ability to handle a wide range of noise levels (i.e., [0, 75]) effectively with a single network; 2) the ability to remove spatially variant noise by specifying a non-uniform noise level map; and 3) faster speed than benchmark BM3D even on CPU without sacrificing denoising performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real noisy images are conducted to evaluate FFDNet in comparison with state-of-the-art denoisers. The results show that FFDNet is effective and efficient, making it highly attractive for practical denoising applications.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2018.2839891","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671182,61471146); HK RGC GRF(grant numbers:PolyU 152124/15E); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8365806","Image denoising;convolutional neural networks;Gaussian noise;spatially variant noise","Noise reduction;Noise level;Image denoising;Noise measurement;Learning systems;AWGN;Visualization","","1806","","64","IEEE","25 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents a conceptual framework for addressing infrastructure interdependencies that could serve as the basis for further understanding and scholarship in this important area. We use this framework to explore the challenges and complexities of interdependency. We set the stage for this discussion by explicitly defining the terms infrastructure, infrastructure dependencies, and infrastructure interdependencies and introducing the fundamental concept of infrastructures as complex adaptive systems. We then focus on the interrelated factors and system conditions that collectively define the six dimensions. Finally, we discuss some of the research challenges involved in developing, applying, and validating modeling and simulation methodologies and tools for infrastructure interdependency analysis.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.969131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969131","","Petroleum;Artificial satellites;Banking;Natural gas;National security;Power system security;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Fuel economy;Couplings","","1806","5","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Using a set of traces of actual user executions of NCSA Mosaic, we examine the dependence structure of WWW traffic. First, we show evidence that WWW traffic exhibits behavior that is consistent with self-similar traffic models. Then we show that the self-similarity in such traffic can be explained based on the underlying distributions of WWW document sizes, the effects of caching and user preference in file transfer, the effect of user ""think time"", and the superimposition of many such transfers in a local-area network. To do this, we rely on empirically measured distributions both from client traces and from data independently collected at WWW servers.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.650143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=650143","","Web sites;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;World Wide Web;Local area networks;Internet;Intelligent networks;Network servers;Web server;Tail","","1806","17","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main problem with frequency offset is that it introduces interference among the multiplicity of carriers in the OFDM signal. It is shown, and confirmed by simulation, that to maintain signal-to-interference ratios of 20 dB or greater for the OFDM carriers, offset is limited to 4% or less of the intercarrier spacing. Next, the paper describes a technique to estimate frequency offset using a repeated data symbol. A maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm is derived and its performance computed and compared with simulation results. Since the intercarrier interference energy and signal energy both contribute coherently to the estimate, the algorithm generates extremely accurate estimates even when the offset is far too great to demodulate the data values. Also, the estimation error depends only on total symbol energy so it is insensitive to channel spreading and frequency selective fading. A strategy is described for initial acquisition in the event of uncertainty in the initial offset that exceeds 1/2 the carrier spacing, the limit of the MLE algorithm.<>","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.328961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=328961","","OFDM;Frequency estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Interference;Digital communication;Computational modeling;Signal generators;Estimation error;Fading;Uncertainty","","1804","180","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hand-shaking style of local exchange by the clock pulses enables one to increase complexity of the LSI RSFQ systems without loss of operating speed.

In this survey, we focus on outdoor terrestrial OWC links which operate in near IR band. These are widely referred to as free space optical (FSO) communication in the literature. FSO systems are used for high rate communication between two fixed points over distances up to several kilometers. In comparison to radio-frequency (RF) counterparts, FSO links have a very high optical bandwidth available, allowing much higher data rates. They are appealing for a wide range of applications such as metropolitan area network (MAN) extension, local area network (LAN)-to-LAN connectivity, fiber back-up, backhaul for wireless cellular networks, disaster recovery, high definition TV and medical image/video transmission, wireless video surveillance/monitoring, and quantum key distribution among others. Despite the major advantages of FSO technology and variety of its application areas, its widespread use has been hampered by its rather disappointing link reliability particularly in long ranges due to atmospheric turbulence-induced fading and sensitivity to weather conditions. In the last five years or so, there has been a surge of interest in FSO research to address these major technical challenges. Several innovative physical layer concepts, originally introduced in the context of RF systems, such as multiple-input multiple-output communication, cooperative diversity, and adaptive transmission have been recently explored for the design of next generation FSO systems. In this paper, we present an up-to-date survey on FSO communication systems. The first part describes FSO channel models and transmitter/receiver structures. In the second part, we provide details on information theoretical limits of FSO channels and algorithmic-level system design research activities to approach these limits.

In this work, we propose a Criss-Cross Network (CCNet) for obtaining such contextual information in a more effective and efficient way. Concretely, for each pixel, a novel criss-cross attention module in CCNet harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies from all pixels. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly. Compared with the non-local block, the proposed recurrent criss-cross attention module requires 11x less GPU memory usage. 2) High computational efficiency. The recurrent criss-cross attention significantly reduces FLOPs by about 85% of the non-local block in computing full-image dependencies. 3) The state-of-the-art performance.

In practice, knowledge of the channel is often obtained by sending known training symbols to the receiver. We show how training affects the capacity of a fading channel-too little training and the channel is improperly learned, too much training and there is no time left for data transmission before the channel changes. We compute a lower bound on the capacity of a channel that is learned by training, and maximize the bound as a function of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), fading coherence time, and number of transmitter antennas. When the training and data powers are allowed to vary, we show that the optimal number of training symbols is equal to the number of transmit antennas-this number is also the smallest training interval length that guarantees meaningful estimates of the channel matrix. When the training and data powers are instead required to be equal, the optimal number of symbols may be larger than the number of antennas. We show that training-based schemes can be optimal at high SNR, but suboptimal at low SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.809594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193803","","Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Wireless communication;Fading;Error probability;Channel capacity;Signal to noise ratio;Transmitters;Data communication;Throughput","","1784","39","21","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis1.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-0457-1","10.1109/CVPR.2017.544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8100027","","Image segmentation;Semantics;Sun;Labeling;Visualization;Neural networks;Computer vision","","1782","6","35","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in CNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size based on multiple scales of input information. A building block called Selective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with different kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the information in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield different sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion layer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel Networks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show that SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower model complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture target objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons for adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.

This model accounts for all dynamic characteristics of the battery, from nonlinear open-circuit voltage, current-, temperature-, cycle number-, and storage time-dependent capacity to transient response. A simplified model neglecting the effects of self-discharge, cycle number, and temperature, which are nonconsequential in low-power Li-ion-supplied applications, is validated with experimental data on NiMH and polymer Li-ion batteries. Less than 0.4% runtime error and 30-mV maximum error voltage show that the proposed model predicts both the battery runtime and I-V performance accurately.

The central task of face recognition, including face verification and identification, involves face feature discrimination. However, the traditional softmax loss of deep CNNs usually lacks the power of discrimination. To address this problem, recently several loss functions such as center loss, large margin softmax loss, and angular softmax loss have been proposed. All these improved losses share the same idea: maximizing inter-class variance and minimizing intra-class variance. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely large margin cosine loss (LMCL), to realize this idea from a different perspective. More specifically, we reformulate the softmax loss as a cosine loss by L2 normalizing both features and weight vectors to remove radial variations, based on which a cosine margin term is introduced to further maximize the decision margin in the angular space. As a result, minimum intra-class variance and maximum inter-class variance are achieved by virtue of normalization and cosine decision margin maximization. We refer to our model trained with LMCL as CosFace. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the most popular public-domain face recognition datasets such as MegaFace Challenge, Youtube Faces (YTF) and Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW). We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks, which confirms the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","2575-7075","978-1-5386-6420-9","10.1109/CVPR.2018.00552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8578650","","Face;Face recognition;Testing;Mars;Training;Feature extraction;Task analysis","","1770","2","48","IEEE","16 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To advance object detection research in Earth Vision, also known as Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, we introduce a large-scale Dataset for Object deTection in Aerial images (DOTA). To this end, we collect 2806 aerial images from different sensors and platforms. Each image is of the size about 4000 × 4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains 188, 282 instances, each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.) quadrilateral.

The extrinsic value is used as an a priori value for the next iteration. Decoding algorithms in the log-likelihood domain are given not only for convolutional codes but also for any linear binary systematic block code. The iteration is controlled by a stop criterion derived from cross entropy, which results in a minimal number of iterations. Optimal and suboptimal decoders with reduced complexity are presented.

This system uses the discrete Fourier transform to orthogonally frequency multiplex many narrow subchannels, each signaling at a very low rate, into one high-rate channel. When this technique is used with pilot-based correction, the effects of flat Rayleigh fading can be reduced significantly. An improvement in signal-to-interference ratio of 6 dB can be obtained over the bursty Rayleigh channel. In addition, with each subchannel signaling at a low rate, this technique can provide added protection against delay spread. To enhance the behavior of the technique in a heavily frequency-selective environment, interpolated pilots are used. A frequency offset reference scheme is employed for the pilots to improve protection against cochannel interference.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOM.1985.1096357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1096357","","Analytical models;OFDM;Rayleigh channels;Frequency;Interchannel interference;Mobile communication;Vehicles;Speech;Protection;Rayleigh scattering","","1734","295","20","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, there is a heavy educational burden even to using an IT2 FLS. This burden has to do with first having to learn general T2 FS mathematics, and then specializing it to an IT2 FSs. In retrospect, we believe that requiring a person to use T2 FS mathematics represents a barrier to the use of an IT2 FLS. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is unnecessary to take the route from general T2 FS to IT2 FS, and that all of the results that are needed to implement an IT2 FLS can be obtained using T1 FS mathematics. As such, this paper is a novel tutorial that makes an IT2 FLS much more accessible to all readers of this journal.

With the recent availability of inexpensive 2.5D depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), it is becoming increasingly important to have a powerful 3D shape representation in the loop. Apart from category recognition, recovering full 3D shapes from view-based 2.5D depth maps is also a critical part of visual understanding. To this end, we propose to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a Convolutional Deep Belief Network. Our model, 3D ShapeNets, learns the distribution of complex 3D shapes across different object categories and arbitrary poses from raw CAD data, and discovers hierarchical compositional part representation automatically. It naturally supports joint object recognition and shape completion from 2.5D depth maps, and it enables active object recognition through view planning. To train our 3D deep learning model, we construct ModelNet - a large-scale 3D CAD model dataset. Extensive experiments show that our 3D deep representation enables significant performance improvement over the-state-of-the-arts in a variety of tasks.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-6964-0","10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298801","","Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Solid modeling;Object recognition;Planning;Computational modeling;Convolution","","1730","18","33","IEEE","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood, and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model, the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable.

Optics has potential benefits in interconnect density, energy, and timing. The necessity of low interconnect energy imposes low limits especially on the energy of the optical output devices, with a ~ 10 fJ/bit device energy target emerging. Some optical modulators and radical laser approaches may meet this requirement. Low (e.g., a few femtofarads or less) photodetector capacitance is important. Very compact wavelength splitters are essential for connecting the information to fibers. Dense waveguides are necessary on-chip or on boards for guided wave optical approaches, especially if very high clock rates or dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is to be avoided. Free-space optics potentially can handle the necessary bandwidths even without fast clocks or WDM.

Basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (PCA) is used to estimate a subspace. Alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3D model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, PCA is used to estimate a subspace. Finally, images rendered from a 3D model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. In this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. More specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. Since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3D reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. We validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407873","Index Terms- Illumination subspaces;illumination cone;face recognition;harmonic images;harmonic subspaces;ambient lighting.","Face recognition;Lighting;Image recognition;Light sources;Principal component analysis;Humans;Shadow mapping;Rendering (computer graphics);Image reconstruction;Image analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Lighting;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","1728","3","23","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although enormous capacity gains have been predicted for such channels, these predictions are based on somewhat unrealistic assumptions about the underlying time-varying channel model and how well it can be tracked at the receiver, as well as at the transmitter. More realistic assumptions can dramatically impact the potential capacity gains of MIMO techniques. For time-varying MIMO channels there are multiple Shannon theoretic capacity definitions and, for each definition, different correlation models and channel information assumptions that we consider. We first provide a comprehensive summary of ergodic and capacity versus outage results for single-user MIMO channels. These results indicate that the capacity gain obtained from multiple antennas heavily depends on the available channel information at either the receiver or transmitter, the channel signal-to-noise ratio, and the correlation between the channel gains on each antenna element. We then focus attention on the capacity region of the multiple-access channels (MACs) and the largest known achievable rate region for the broadcast channel. In contrast to single-user MIMO channels, capacity results for these multiuser MIMO channels are quite difficult to obtain, even for constant channels. We summarize results for the MIMO broadcast and MAC for channels that are either constant or fading with perfect instantaneous knowledge of the antenna gains at both transmitter(s) and receiver(s). We show that the capacity region of the MIMO multiple access and the largest known achievable rate region (called the dirty-paper region) for the MIMO broadcast channel are intimately related via a duality transformation. This transformation facilitates finding the transmission strategies that achieve a point on the boundary of the MIMO MAC capacity region in terms of the transmission strategies of the MIMO broadcast dirty-paper region and vice-versa. Finally, we discuss capacity results for multicell MIMO channels with base station cooperation. The base stations then act as a spatially diverse antenna array and transmission strategies that exploit this structure exhibit significant capacity gains. This section also provides a brief discussion of system level issues associated with MIMO cellular. Open problems in this field abound and are discussed throughout the paper.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.810294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203154","","MIMO;Transmitting antennas;Broadcasting;Receiving antennas;Channel capacity;Transmitters;Base stations;Time-varying channels;Predictive models;Signal to noise ratio","","1722","61","89","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine recognition of faces has several applications, ranging from static matching of controlled photographs as in mug shots matching and credit card verification to surveillance video images. Such applications have different constraints in terms of complexity of processing requirements and thus present a wide range of different technical challenges. Over the last 20 years researchers in psychophysics, neural sciences and engineering, image processing analysis and computer vision have investigated a number of issues related to face recognition by humans and machines. Ongoing research activities have been given a renewed emphasis over the last five years. Existing techniques and systems have been tested on different sets of images of varying complexities. But very little synergism exists between studies in psychophysics and the engineering literature. Most importantly, there exists no evaluation or benchmarking studies using large databases with the image quality that arises in commercial and law enforcement applications In this paper, we first present different applications of face recognition in commercial and law enforcement sectors. This is followed by a brief overview of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community. We then present a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community. Techniques for segmentation/location of the face, feature extraction and recognition are reviewed.

In this paper we introduce a novel benchmark ""MPII Human Pose"" that makes a significant advance in terms of diversity and difficulty, a contribution that we feel is required for future developments in human body models. This comprehensive dataset was collected using an established taxonomy of over 800 human activities [1]. The collected images cover a wider variety of human activities than previous datasets including various recreational, occupational and householding activities, and capture people from a wider range of viewpoints. We provide a rich set of labels including positions of body joints, full 3D torso and head orientation, occlusion labels for joints and body parts, and activity labels. For each image we provide adjacent video frames to facilitate the use of motion information. Given these rich annotations we perform a detailed analysis of leading human pose estimation approaches and gaining insights for the success and failures of these methods.","1063-6919","978-1-4799-5118-5","10.1109/CVPR.2014.471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909866","human pose estimation;performance evaluation","Estimation;Complexity theory;Joints;Torso;Benchmark testing;Measurement;Training","","1717","5","23","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We rank the similarity of the image elements (pixels or regions) with foreground cues or background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of the image elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or queries. We represent the image as a close-loop graph with super pixels as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on the similarity to background and foreground queries, based on affinity matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a two-stage scheme to extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. Experimental results on two large benchmark databases demonstrate the proposed method performs well when against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.

We describe how the dataset was collected, in particular the automated and manual filtering stages to ensure a high accuracy for the images of each identity. To assess face recognition performance using the new dataset, we train ResNet-50 (with and without Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks) Convolutional Neural Networks on VGGFace2, on MS-Celeb-1M, and on their union, and show that training on VGGFace2 leads to improved recognition performance over pose and age.

Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet achieves 75.2% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8× faster than MobileNetV2 with 0.5% higher accuracy and 2.3× faster than NASNet with 1.2% higher accuracy.

In this paper, we employ a time-average age metric for the performance evaluation of status update systems. We derive general methods for calculating the age metric that can be applied to a broad class of service systems. We apply these methods to queue-theoretic system abstractions consisting of a source, a service facility and monitors, with the model of the service facility (physical constraints) a given. The queue discipline of first-come-first-served (FCFS) is explored. We show the existence of an optimal rate at which a source must generate its information to keep its status as timely as possible at all its monitors. This rate differs from those that maximize utilization (throughput) or minimize status packet delivery delay. While our abstractions are simpler than their real-world counterparts, the insights obtained, we believe, are a useful starting point in understanding and designing systems that support real time status updates.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0775-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195689","","Monitoring;Servers;Real time systems;Temperature sensors;Silicon;Vehicles","","1713","","16","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This process arises in such diverse subjects as the short-term storage of visual or language patterns by neural networks, pattern formation due to the firing of morphogenetic gradients in developmental biology, control of choice behavior during macromolecular evolution, and the design of stable context-sensitive parallel processors. In addition to systems capable of approaching one of perhaps infinitely many equilibrium points in response to arbitrary input patterns and initial data, one finds in these subjects a wide variety of other behaviors, notably traveling waves, standing waves, resonance, and chaos. The question of what general dynamical constraints cause global approach to equilibria rather than large amplitude waves is therefore of considerable interest. In another terminology, this is the question of whether global pattern formation occurs. A related question is whether the global pattern formation property persists when system parameters slowly change in an unpredictable fashion due to self-organization (development, learning). This is the question of absolute stability of global pattern formation. It is shown that many model systems which exhibit the absolute stability property can be written in the form ${dx_i\over dt} = a_i (x_i)\left[b_i(x_i)-\sum^n_{k = 1} c_{ik} d_k (x_k)\right]$ (1) i = 1, 2, …, n, where the matrix C = ‖cik‖ is symmetric and the system as a whole is competitive. Under these circumstances, this system defines a global Liapunov function. The absolute stability of systems with infinite but totally disconnected sets of equilibrium points can then be studied using the LaSalle invariance principle, the theory of several complex variables, and Sard's theorem. The symmetry of matrix C is important since competitive systems of the form (1) exist wherein C is arbitrarily close to a symmetric matrix but almost all trajectories persistently oscillate, as in the voting paradox. Slowing down the competitive feedback without violating symmetry, as in the systems ${dx_i\over dt} = a_i (x_i)\left[b_i(x_i)-\sum^n_{k = 1} c_{ik} d_k (y_k)\right]$ ${dy_i\over dt} = e_i (x_i)[f_i(x_i)-y_i],$ also enables sustained oscillations to occur. Our results thus show that the use of fast symmetric competitive feedback is a robust design constraint for guaranteeing absolute stability of global pattern formation.","2168-2909","","10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6313075","","Stability analysis;Pattern formation;Trajectory;Symmetric matrices;Equations;Neural networks;Mathematical model","","1708","1","","IEEE","26 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We tackle this by combining the strengths of robust illumination normalization, local texture-based face representations, distance transform based matching, kernel-based feature extraction and multiple feature fusion. Specifically, we make three main contributions: 1) we present a simple and efficient preprocessing chain that eliminates most of the effects of changing illumination while still preserving the essential appearance details that are needed for recognition; 2) we introduce local ternary patterns (LTP), a generalization of the local binary pattern (LBP) local texture descriptor that is more discriminant and less sensitive to noise in uniform regions, and we show that replacing comparisons based on local spatial histograms with a distance transform based similarity metric further improves the performance of LBP/LTP based face recognition; and 3) we further improve robustness by adding Kernel principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction and incorporating rich local appearance cues from two complementary sources-Gabor wavelets and LBP-showing that the combination is considerably more accurate than either feature set alone. The resulting method provides state-of-the-art performance on three data sets that are widely used for testing recognition under difficult illumination conditions: Extended Yale-B, CAS-PEAL-R1, and Face Recognition Grand Challenge version 2 experiment 4 (FRGC-204). For example, on the challenging FRGC-204 data set it halves the error rate relative to previously published methods, achieving a face verification rate of 88.1% at 0.1% false accept rate. Further experiments show that our preprocessing method outperforms several existing preprocessors for a range of feature sets, data sets and lighting conditions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2042645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411802","Face recognition;illumination invariance;image preprocessing;kernel principal components analysis;local binary patterns;visual features","Face recognition;Lighting;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Pattern recognition;Histograms;Wavelet transforms;Noise robustness;Kernel;Wavelet analysis","Algorithms;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lighting;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","1707","18","53","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a computational implementation of the clonal selection principle that explicitly takes into account the affinity maturation of the immune response. The general algorithm, named CLONALG, is derived primarily to perform machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, and then it is adapted to solve optimization problems, emphasizing multimodal and combinatorial optimization. Two versions of the algorithm are derived, their computational cost per iteration is presented, and a sensitivity analysis in relation to the user-defined parameters is given.

It is shown that theK-user maximum-likelihood sequence detector consists of a bank of single-user matched filters followed by a Viterbi algorithm whose complexity per binary decision isO(2^{K}). The upper bound analysis of this detector follows an approach based on the decomposition of error sequences. The issues of convergence and tightness of the bounds are examined, and it is shown that the minimum multiuser error probability is equivalent in the Iow-noise region to that of a single-user system with reduced power. These results show that the proposed multiuser detectors afford important performance gains over conventional single-user systems, in which the signal constellation carries the entire burden of complexity required to achieve a given performance level.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.1986.1057121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1057121","","","","1699","113","24","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that the combination series-parallel converter, which takes on the desirable characteristics of the pure series and the pure parallel converter, avoids the main disadvantages of each of them. Analyses and breadboard results show that the combination converter can run over a large input voltage range and a large load range (no load to full load) while maintaining excellent efficiency. A useful analysis technique based on classical AC complex analysis is introduced.<>","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.4347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4347","","Resonance;Topology;Power supplies;Voltage","","1698","47","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The convolution weights of KPConv are located in Euclidean space by kernel points, and applied to the input points close to them. Its capacity to use any number of kernel points gives KPConv more flexibility than fixed grid convolutions. Furthermore, these locations are continuous in space and can be learned by the network. Therefore, KPConv can be extended to deformable convolutions that learn to adapt kernel points to local geometry. Thanks to a regular subsampling strategy, KPConv is also efficient and robust to varying densities. Whether they use deformable KPConv for complex tasks, or rigid KPconv for simpler tasks, our networks outperform state-of-the-art classification and segmentation approaches on several datasets. We also offer ablation studies and visualizations to provide understanding of what has been learned by KPConv and to validate the descriptive power of deformable KPConv.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010002","","Kernel;Convolution;Three-dimensional displays;Correlation;Robustness;Two dimensional displays;Geometry","","1698","","48","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
