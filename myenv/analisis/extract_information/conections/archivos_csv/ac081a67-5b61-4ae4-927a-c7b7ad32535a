abstract = {I identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) G352.7-0.1 and propose that the outer axially-symmetric structure is the remnant of a common envelope evolution (CEE) of the progenitor system, while the inner structure is the ejecta of a thermonuclear explosion triggered by the merger of a white dwarf (WD) and the core of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The main radio structure of SNR G352.7-0.1 forms an outer (large) ellipse. The bright X-ray emitting gas forms a smaller ellipse with a symmetry axis inclined to the symmetry axis of the large radio ellipse. The high abundance of iron and the energy of its X-ray lines suggest a type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The massive swept-up gas suggests a relatively massive progenitor system. I propose a scenario with progenitors of initial masses of MZAMS,1≃5–7M⊙ and MZAMS,2≃4–5M⊙. At a later phase, the WD remnant of the primary star and the AGB secondary star experience a CEE that ejects the circumstellar material that swept up more ISM to form the large elliptical radio structure. An explosion during the merger of the WD with the core of the AGB star triggered a super-Chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosion that formed the inner structure that is bright in X-ray. A tertiary star in the system caused the misalignment of the two symmetry axes. This study adds to the wide variety of evolutionary routes within the scenarios of normal and peculiar SNe Ia.}

On the other hand, there is the option of a Subcutaneous Iliopubic Plate (SIP) osteosynthesis. Only limited comparative biomechanical data of these two devices are available. Therefore, this biomechanical study's objective was to compare the stabilizing effect of the SEF versus the SIP in a model of Fragility Fractures of the Pelvis (FFP) type Ia. A test stand for pelvic biomechanics testing that emulates the gait loading cycle with physiological relevance was used. The osteotomy on the right pelvic ring was stabilized either with the SEF or the SIP. Strain gauges were used to measure strain in the pelvic ring. The osteotomy's spatial interfragmentary displacement (SID) was monitored using a 3D digital image correlation system. The SEF stabilization reduced the SID by approximately 10%, whereas the locking SIP could reduce displacement by about 62%. Additionally, the SIP reduced the stress/strain levels by 67% in the posterior pelvic ring. We could demonstrate that the SIP is superior to SEF in treating FFP type Ia as it significantly reduced the osteotomy's SID and the strain in the posterior pelvic ring.}

abstract = {Objective
The predictive value of serum tumor markers (STMs) in assessing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly those with non-stage IA, remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is to construct a predictive model comprising STMs and additional clinical characteristics, aiming to achieve precise prediction of EGFR mutations through noninvasive means.
Materials and methods
We retrospectively collected 6711 NSCLC patients who underwent EGFR gene testing. Ultimately, 3221 stage IA patients and 1442 non-stage IA patients were analyzed to evaluate the potential predictive value of several clinical characteristics and STMs for EGFR mutations.
Results
EGFR mutations were detected in 3866 patients (57.9 %) of all NSCLC patients. None of the STMs emerged as significant predictor for predicting EGFR mutations in stage IA patients. Patients with non-stage IA were divided into the study group (n = 1043) and validation group (n = 399). In the study group, univariate analysis revealed significant associations between EGFR mutations and the STMs (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1)). The nomogram incorporating CEA, CYFRA 21-1, pathology, gender, and smoking history for predicting EGFR mutations with non-stage IA was constructed using the results of multivariate analysis. The area under the curve (AUC = 0.780) and decision curve analysis demonstrated favorable predictive performance and clinical utility of nomogram. Additionally, the Random Forest model also demonstrated the highest average C-index of 0.793 among the eight machine learning algorithms, showcasing superior predictive efficiency.
Conclusion
CYFRA21-1 and CEA have been identified as crucial factors for predicting EGFR mutations in non-stage IA NSCLC patients. The nomogram and 8 machine learning models that combined STMs with other clinical factors could effectively predict the probability of EGFR mutations.}

The ANNs employed in this study utilize genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning and Monte Carlo Dropout for predictions. Our ANN reconstruction architecture is capable of modeling both the distance moduli and their associated statistical errors given redshift values. We compare the performance of the ANN-based reconstruction with two theoretical dark energy models: ΛCDM and Chevallier–Linder–Polarski (CPL). Bayesian analysis is conducted for these theoretical models using the LSST simulations and compared with observations from Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNIa real data. We demonstrate that our model-independent ANN reconstruction is consistent with both theoretical models. Performance metrics and statistical tests reveal that the ANN produces distance modulus estimates that align well with the LSST dataset and exhibit only minor discrepancies with ΛCDM and CPL.}

abstract = {The pathogen S. agalactiae, categorized as Lancefield group B streptococci (GBS), is a Gram-positive bacterium, encapsulated, anaerobic facultative bacillus, which occurs in pairs or short chains. It was responsible for more than 319,000 cases of infections in neonates. Early and late streptococci, in the course of an illness or medical condition, are infections that have high mortality and morbidity rates, with an incidence of 2.0 to 5.0 per 1000 live births in North America, Europe, and Australia. The infection of newborns usually happens through transmission from infected mothers during and after childbirth, with GBS being among the critical bacterial infections in the Brazilian epidemiological picture. S. agalactiae strains isolated from different regions of Brazil, indicate a great diversity among the isolated serotypes but with a higher incidence of serotype Ia. Publications report that, in pregnant women in Brazil, the prevalence of serotype Ia has been constant between 2002 and 2018, followed by serotypes II and IV. Serotypes Ib, III, and V also appear, but with some fluctuations in different regions of the country. The pathogen which causes invasive disease are usually surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule and is its major virulence factor, being that the key antigen in protective response triggered by polysaccharides and, more recently, protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. The development of antibiotic resistance by these microorganisms to different antibiotics has been the guideline in leading therapeutic options against these infections including the use of prophylactic vaccines in pregnant women, immunosuppressed or older people. Such prophylactic alternatives can be constructed from capsular polysaccharides. Based on the experience in the production and purification of Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharides for vaccines, Bio-Manguinhos developed a process for the production, purification and characterization of S. agalactiae Ia polysaccharides. In the present study, the capsular polysaccharide from the strain isolated in clinical material of a public hospital, in Rio de Janeiro – Brazil, was obtained from simple batch cultures, with purification process achieving about 20 mg g−1 in yield for cell dry weight (CDW) and ca. of 100 % of purity. Hence, to prove that the CPS of GBS Ia can be consistently produced, purified, and characterized by NMR, HRGC-MS, and SEC-MALS – from such strain – to be used in vaccine productions against S. agalactiae.}

abstract = {Purpose
To develop and compare 3 different machine learning–based models of clinical information and integrated radiomics features predicting the local recurrence of Stage Ia lung adenocarcinoma after microwave ablation (MWA) for assisting clinical decision making.
Materials and Methods
The data of 360 patients with Stage Ia lung adenocarcinoma who underwent MWA were included in the training (n = 208), internal test (n = 90), and external test (n = 62) sets based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The predictors associated with local recurrence were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical information. The integrated radiomics features were extracted from pre-MWA and post-MWA (scanned immediately after the ablation) computed tomography (CT) images, and 10 radiomics features were selected by the t-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The L2-logistic regression of machine learning was applied for the clinical model, CT radiomics model, and combined model including clinical predictors and radiomics features. Model performance was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analysis.
Results
The ablative margin was an independent clinical predictor (P = 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73). The combined model showed the highest area under the curve value among the 3 models (training, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.91; internal test, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87–0.98; external test, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–0.96).
Conclusions
The combined model could accurately predict the local recurrence of Stage Ia lung adenocarcinoma after MWA to better support a clinical decision.}

Renal G6Pase-α deficiency in GSD-Ia is characterized by impaired gluconeogenesis, nephromegaly due to elevated glycogen accumulation, and nephropathy caused, in part, by renal fibrosis, mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates the expression of a variety of downstream mediators implicated in renal fibrosis, including multiple genes in the RAS. Sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is associated with the development and progression of renal fibrotic lesions that can lead to chronic kidney disease. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism underlying GSD-Ia nephropathy. Damage to the kidney proximal tubules is known to trigger acute kidney injury (AKI) that can, in turn, activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We show that GSD-Ia mice have AKI that leads to activation of the Wnt/β-catenin/RAS axis. Renal fibrosis was demonstrated by increased renal levels of Snail1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen-Iα1 and collagen-IV. Treating GSD-Ia mice with a CBP/β-catenin inhibitor, ICG-001, significantly decreased nuclear translocated active β-catenin and reduced renal levels of renin, Snail1, α-SMA, and collagen-IV. The results suggest that inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for GSD-Ia nephropathy.}

abstract = {Objective
Although recent trials on intentional segmentectomy have made mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) mandatory, the necessity of MLND in segmentectomy remains uncertain. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the necessity of MLND in segmentectomy for patients with peripheral stage IA (≤2 cm) non–small cell lung cancer.
Methods
Of the 5222 surgical cases for non–small cell lung cancer from 3 institutions between 2010 and 2021, 1457 patients met the JCOG0802 trial eligibility criteria. Initially, we analyzed 574 patients who underwent lobectomy with MLND to identify preoperative risk factors for cN0-pN2 occurrence (cohort 1). Subsequently, we evaluated the relationship between these factors and the cumulative postoperative recurrence in 390 patients who underwent segmentectomy (cohort 2).
Results
In cohort 1, risk factors for cN0-pN2 occurrence were consolidation-to-tumor ratio = 1.0 and maximum standardized uptake value ≥2.0. When classifying patients into 3 groups (group A, without any factors, group B, with either factor, and group C, with both factors), the occurrence of cN0-pN2 was significantly greater in group C than in the other groups (0.9%, 3.4%, and 8.4%, respectively, P = .005). When classifying patients in cohort 2 using the classification identified in cohort 1 (117, 131, and 142 were categorized into group A, group B, and group C, respectively), the 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence rate was significantly greater in group C than in others (2.0%, 2.0%, and 15.9%, respectively, P < .001).
Conclusions
MLND is unlikely to be beneficial in intentional segmentectomy for patients with tumors showing consolidation-to-tumor ratio <1.0 and maximum standardized uptake value <2.0.}

The data on age distribution, clinical symptoms at onset, CA125 detection, MRI findings, including tumor volume, structure, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and enhancement, etc., of the patients with stage IA ovarian cancer, who were admitted to Nantong tumor Hospital between 2013 and 2020 were analyzed retrospectively.
Results
Only 11 cases of stage IA ovarian cancer were recorded. The age of patients was 30–67 (average 52) years. The initial symptoms were mostly lower abdominal distension and abdominal pain. CA125 was 90% positive. MRI features 1. Large pelvic mass with a volume range of 23–2,009 cm3 (average 669 cm3). 2. Five cases of cyst type (with plaque-like, papillary, or mural nodule vegetations), two cases of cystic-solid mixed type (with thickened septum or wall), and four cases of solid type. 3. DWI diffusion was limited, and ADC was reduced on all solid components (vegetation, septa, and cyst wall). 4. The solid parts were significantly enhanced on T1-enhanced MRI. 5. There was no metastasis in the pelvic cavity, and a few ascites (negative tumor cells) in three patients.

abstract = {Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymeric materials that are typically distinguished by their excellent biocompatibility, flexibility, and environmental friendliness. However, most hydrogels exhibit high swelling rates, poor mechanical stability, and low durability, which restrict their utilization in sensor applications. Herein, conductive hydrogels with a low swelling rate were fabricated by incorporating polypyrrole (PPy)/ ferric ion (Fe3+) into poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)/itaconic acid (PSBMA-IA) based hydrogels. The abundance of unsaturated bonds on SBMA and IA macromolecules enables them to undergo addition polymerization and form their respective long chains. The carbon–carbon double bonds at both ends of Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) can also undergo addition reactions with the double bonds of SBMA and IA, resulting in the formation of a three-dimensional interconnective network. This ultimately improves the mechanical properties of the composite hydrogel (maximum compressive stress of 66.7 kPa). Furthermore, Fe3+ ions and pyrrole monomers facilitate the formation of an additional conductive macromolecular network on the hydrogel skeleton through in situ polymerization. This dual network structure confers enhanced anti-swelling properties (minimum swelling rate of 33 %), and excellent electrical conductivity (>0.2 S/m). As a result, the PSBMA-IA-PPy/Fe3+ based hydrogel sensors exhibit low detection (0.543 ∼ 2.717 kPa), high sensitivity (1.4853 ∼ 1.8316), and excellent response and recovery times (<106 ms).}

abstract = {Background
In the FIGO 2018 classification, women with cervical cancer and a depth of invasion ≤ 5 mm and a horizontal spread of > 7 mm in excisional biopsy with tumour-free margins, are now classified as stage IA instead of IB. This stage shift may reduce the likelihood of surgical lymph node staging. It is therefore crucial to estimate the risk and risk factors of lymph node metastasis (pN+) in this group.
Methods
Women diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2005 and 2022 were identified from nationwide population-based registries from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden. Inclusion criteria were squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, FIGO 2009 stage IB1, a depth of invasion ≤ 5 mm and horizontal spread of > 7–≤ 40 mm. All cases underwent radical hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy, and surgical lymph node staging. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of pN+.
Results
We included 992 women (pN+ 4.1 %; n = 41). Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) was a significant risk factor of pN+ (odds ratio 4.26, 95 % confidence interval 2.24–8.32). Accordingly, the risk of pN+ was ≥ 7.3 % in LVSI-positive tumours. The risk was lowest in LVSI-negative tumours with a size of > 7–≤ 20 mm (2.2 %), although this varied by depth of invasion and histological subtype (pN+ range 0.6–5.1 %).
Conclusion
Women with LVSI-positive FIGO 2018 IA cervical cancer and a horizontal spread > 7 mm, should undergo surgical lymph node staging. In LVSI-negative tumours, lymph node staging should not be routinely performed; tumour size, depth of invasion and histology should be considered.}

abstract = {Background
Recent randomized trials have shown equivalent survival after sublobar resection vs lobectomy in patients with clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤2 cm. High maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) is a known risk factor in NSCLC, yet limited data exist on whether a high SUV should preclude a sublobar resection. This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between SUVmax and survival based on the extent of parenchymal resection.
Methods
A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained institutional database was conducted to identify patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC ≤2 cm (2011-2020) treated with sublobar resection or lobectomy. The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival (CSS). Secondary outcomes were overall survival and disease-free survival.
Results
There were 543 patients identified; 36.8% had sublobar resection and 63.2% had lobectomy. Baseline characteristics were similar. Patients who had sublobar resection had significantly worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and higher rates of comorbidities. The 5-year CSS, overall survival, and disease-free survival for the whole cohort were similar between sublobar resection and lobectomy. A receiver operating characteristic curve estimated the SUVmax cutoff point to be 4.15. For the whole cohort, patients with SUVmax >4.15 had worse CSS compared with SUVmax ≤4.15. However, there was no significant difference in 5-year CSS after sublobar resection vs lobectomy in patients with SUVmax ≤4.15 (98% in both groups; P = .77) or patients with SUVmax >4.15 (90% vs 94%, respectively; P = .12).
Conclusions
SUVmax may not be a useful clinical determinant of the extent of parenchymal resection in patients with cT1 N0 NSCLC ≤2 cm. Patients treated by sublobar resection had comparable survival to lobectomy, irrespective of positron emission tomography avidity.}

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preference of MAD appliances for patients diagnosed with OSA and bruxism using TAP 3 and modified ProSomnus IA oral appliances.
METHODS
Twelve patients diagnosed with OSA were referred for fabrication of a mandibular advancement device (MAD). At the initial appointment each patient was evaluated for signs and symptoms of bruxism. If bruxism was diagnosed the patient was informed of and given the choice to enroll in the research project. Once enrolled and informed consent obtained, digital scans of the patient were acquired using the Primescan (Dentsply Sirona) while in 50-60% of maximum protrusion. The ProSomnus IA was modified to have wings extended 2mm laterally to give similar range of lateral movement as the TAP 3. Patients were randomly chosen for which MAD would be delivered first. One MAD was delivered and used for one month. After one month the patient returned to the clinic and received the alternative MAD. At the final appointment, the patient was asked which device was preferred for long-term treatment.
RESULTS
8 patients enrolled in this study preferred the ProSomnus IA for treatment of OSA over the TAP 3 MAD. One patient was not able to tolerate either device and one dropped out of the study. The two patients who preferred the TAP 3 also used a CPAP simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS
The modified ProSomnus IA was the preferred device for patients with OSA and bruxism. Patients who used the CPAP and MAD preferred the TAP 3. Patients selected the ProSomnus IA for the following reasons: the ability to open mouth with the IA, increased comfort, and ease of use. The IA was not chosen when the patient also used a CPAP due to discomfort from the wings of the IA on the buccal mucosa when used with a CPAP mask.
IMPLICATIONS
This project compared the preference between the Prosomnus IA and TAP3 appliance in patients that are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and bruxism, potentially improving the decision making for clinicians when treating a patient with OSA and bruxism. Choosing the preferred device first will allow the patient to potentially receive successful treatment for OSA and bruxism in a more timely manner, increasing compliance, saving valuable clinic time, and preventing costly remakes.}

FTIR-ATR, TGA, XRD, and TEM experiments were utilized to explore the Fe3O4-TMSPM/HG nanocomposite hydrogel. Swelling studies were also carried out in water, in different pH media, and then used in the adsorption of the cationic dye methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The factors controlling the adsorption process such as pH, dose, contact time, initial MB concentration, and temperature were investigated. The maximum MB adsorption capacity (270.27 mg/g) using Fe3O4-TMSPM/HG was obtained under the best conditions pH 8, dose 0.5 mg/mL, contact time 24 h, and ambient laboratory temperature (≈15 °C). The kinetic and isothermal experiments showed that the adsorption of MB followed the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. The effect of temperature on the adsorption capacity is related to the swelling, since the Fe3O4-TMSPM/HG nanocomposite hydrogel exhibit temperature-responsive. After 5 adsorption–desorption cycles, the adsorption decreased by 19 mg/g compared to the initial adsorption capacity. All the experimental results show that the prepared Fe3O4-TMSPM/HG nanocomposite hydrogel has the potential to be applied as an adsorbent for MB dye.}

Introduction
Les applications possibles de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) en chirurgie orthopédique sont prometteuses. Le deep learning est utilisable en chirurgie arthroscopique grâce au signal vidéo exploitable par computer vision. La gestion peropératoire du tendon du long biceps (TLB) est l’objet d’une controverse ancienne. L’objectif principal de cette étude était de modéliser une IA diagnostique capable de statuer sur le caractère sain ou pathologique du TLB sur des images arthroscopiques. L’objectif secondaire était de créer un deuxième modèle IA diagnostique en fonction d’images arthroscopiques et des données médicales de chaque patient, cliniques et imagerie, pour statuer sur le caractère sain ou pathologique du TLB.
Hypothèse
L’hypothèse de l’étude était qu’il était possible de construire un modèle IA à partir d’images opératoires d’arthroscopie d’aide au diagnostic du caractère sain ou pathologique du TLB qui ferait mieux qu’une analyse humaine.
Matériels et méthodes
Les données prospectives cliniques et d’imagerie de 199 patients ont été collectées et associées aux images issues d’une analyse vidéo arthroscopique protocolisée validée, dite « vérité terrain », faite par le chirurgien opérateur. Un modèle basé sur un réseau neuronal convolutif (RNC) modélisé via un transfer learning sur le modèle Inception V3 a été construit pour l’analyse des images arthroscopiques. Ce modèle a ensuite été couplé à un perceptron multicouche (MultiLayer Perceptron, MLP) intégrant les données cliniques et imageries. Chaque modèle a été entraîné et testé selon apprentissage supervisé.
Résultats
La précision du RNC sur le diagnostic du statut sain ou pathologique du TLB était de 93,7 % en apprentissage et 80,66 % en généralisation. Couplé aux données cliniques de chaque patient, la précision du modèle assemblant le RNC et un MLP étaient respectivement de 77 % et 58 % en apprentissage et en généralisation.
Conclusion
Le modèle IA construit à partir d’un RNC parvient à déterminer le caractère sain ou pathologique du TLB avec un taux de précision de 80,66 %. Une augmentation des données d’entrée pour limiter l’overfitting, et l’automatisation de la phase de détection par un Mask-R-CNN sont des voies d’amélioration du modèle. Cette étude est la première à évaluer la capacité d’une IA à analyser des images arthroscopiques. Ses résultats doivent être confirmés par d’autres études sur le sujet.
Niveau de preuve
III ; étude diagnostique.}

The theory, introduced by Bakry and Ibraheem in 2023, combines the Ricci scalar, a scalar parameter representing torsion or other geometric properties, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By analyzing observational Hubble data (OHD) and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), we explore how this framework provides the accelerated expansion of the universe, the nature of dark energy, and phenomena like the Big Rip singularity. Employing the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and solving the modified field equations, we derive key cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and matter energy density parameter. These parameters are constrained through statistical analysis of observational data, yielding and from OHD, and from SN Ia. The evolution of the equation of state (EoS) parameter, isotropic pressure, and energy density is also investigated. By considering energy conditions and stability criteria, the study highlights the viability of gravity as an alternative framework to General Relativity and models. Our findings affirm the model's compatibility with current observational evidence and its potential to the universe's past and future dynamics.}

A novel scenario has been proposed: When a PBH with mass 10−14≤MPBH/M⊙≤10−11 transits through a white dwarf (WD) made up of carbon and oxygen, Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion in a reactive medium creates a shock wave, which generates direct detonation ignition in the WD core and then leads to thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia). The aim of this study is to impose constraints on the PBH to dark matter (DM) abundance fraction, fPBH, via comparing the SN Ia event rates between PBH hypotheses and observational data. For PBH fraction less than unity, we found the observed event rate prefers PBH mass region, 7.6×10−13≤MPBH/M⊙≤6.1×10−12, under the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile. Meanwhile, the aforementioned PBH mass and abundance can be efficiently produced via a cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) in dark sector which associates with O(MeV) energy scale and thus gives rise to complementary signals of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) with peak frequencies from 10−6 Hz to 10−5 Hz which can be probed by future μAres GW interferometer.}

abstract = {Objectives
Optimal management of patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion, classified as intermediate risk in the 2020 European Society of Gynaecological Oncology, European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, and European Society of Pathology (ESGO-ESTRO-ESP) guidelines, and the 2022 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, is currently unclear. Practice varies from surgery alone to adjuvant radiation±chemotherapy. Our aim was to assess the risk of disease recurrence in patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion compared with stage IA with myoinvasion (<50%).
Methods
Stage IA p53abn endometrial cancers were identified from retrospective cohorts. Cases were segregated into stage IA with no myoinvasion, including (1) tumor restricted to a polyp, (2) residual endometrial tumor, and (3) no residual tumor in hysterectomy specimen, versus stage IA p53abn with myoinvasion (<50%), with treatment and outcomes assessed.
Results
There were 65 stage IA p53abn endometrial cancers with no myoinvasion (22 polyp confined, 38 residual endometrial tumor, 2 no residual in hysterectomy specimen, 3 not specified) and 97 with myoinvasion. There was no difference in survival outcomes in patients with stage IA without myoinvasion (16% of patients recurred, 19% if there was residual endometrial disease) compared with stage IA with myoinvasion (17%). The risk of recurrence was lowest in patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion treated with chemotherapy±radiation (8%). Most recurrences in patients with stage IA without myoinvasion were distant (89%), with no isolated vaginal vault recurrences, and all except one distant recurrence occurred in patients who had not received adjuvant chemotherapy.
Conclusion
The recurrence rate in patients with stage IA p53abn endometrial cancer without myoinvasion was 16%, highest in the setting of residual endometrial disease (19%), and exceeding the threshold where adjuvant therapy is often considered. The high frequency of distant recurrences observed may support chemotherapy as part of the treatment regimen.}

abstract = {Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are a heterogenous group of congenital blood diseases, characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, secondary iron overload, and the presence of bi- or multinucleated erythroblasts in the bone marrow (BM). Several CDA types exist and they were originally classified by BM pathological findings. CDAs are now more accurately classified by their causative mutations when these are identifiable. CDA type-Ia is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the CDAN1 gene, which encodes Codanin-1 (Cdan1), a highly conserved protein. Currently, there are no known patients with complete loss of CDAN1, indicating that total loss of CDAN1 is incompatible with life. Patients with CDA-Ia frequently require transfusions in utero to survive and present with varying degrees of hemolytic anemia with relative reticulocytopenia (suggesting ineffective erythropoiesis). BM pathology reveals erythroid hyperplasia with 3-10% binucleated erythroblasts, the rare but characteristic finding of internuclear chromatin bridges between nearly-completely separated erythroblasts, and, under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a “Swiss cheese” appearance in the nuclear heterochromatin of erythroid precursors. Blood transfusions and iron chelation are needed for many patients with CDA-Ia, while treatment with IFN-α is also an option. Most patients treated with IFN-α achieve transfusion independence and appear to have alleviated iron overload, suggesting that IFN-α may somehow interact with erythroblasts, erythroblast turn over, or another unknown mechanism. Previous efforts have been made to understand pathogenesis in CDA-Ia using mouse models with constitutional erythroid-specific deletion of CDAN1; however, this model leads to failure of primitive erythropoiesis and death by mid-gestation (E12.5-E13.5) due to severe anemia, allowing limited in vivo studies to investigate the role of CDAN1 in erythropoiesis [1Noy-lotan S. et al, 2021 Front Physiol]. Alternatively, it may be more relevant to study CDA-Ia during definitive erythropoiesis, instead of primitive erythropoiesis, as a means to investigate the pathogenesis of Cdan1 deficiency in erythropoiesis and the therapeutic effect of IFN-α. Therefore, we hypothesized that a temporal and spatial approach to deleting CDAN1 may provide a mouse model which avoids the stressful period of fetal erythropoiesis, replicates the disease in patients with diminished CDAN1 function, and is amenable to IFN-α treatment. We generated our model from CDAN1flox/flox mice, originating from the CDAN1 knockout-first model [1], and bred with Gata1creERT2+ mice [2Yu L. et al Blood 2021]. To test our hypothesis, we induced deletion of CDAN1 in Gata1creERT2+; CDAN1flox/flox and control mice by tamoxifen treatment (i.p.) every other day, for a total of 10 injections. Two days after the final injection, we harvested the blood, hind limbs, and spleens for analysis. We performed CBCs and flow cytometry to assess terminal erythropoiesis in the BM and spleen. RT-qPCR and PCR were used to examine the recombination efficiency of CDAN1 at the RNA and DNA level, respectively. We found that Cdan1-deficient mice had splenomegaly and were anemic compared to control mice, with variable reticulocyte counts. We also found that the red cell distribution width (RDW) was increased with noticeable macrocytosis. Light microscopy of BM and spleen cytospins revealed binucleated erythroblasts and chromatin bridges, typical of CDA-Ia. TEM imaging on Cdan1-deficient mouse erythroblasts revealed a “Swiss cheese” appearance in the heterochromatin, the pathognomonic finding of CDA-Ia. Flow cytometry of whole BM and spleen showed reduced late erythroblasts in the BM but a marked increase in splenic stress erythropoiesis, leading only to a partial erythropoietic compensation of the resulting anemia in Cdan1-deficient mice. There was substantial deletion of CDAN1 mRNA expression in Ter119+ cells from the BM and spleen, although a complete recombination of the CDAN1 gene was not achieved. Overall, these data support the notion that this is a suitable mouse model on which to study the pathological mechanisms causing CDA-Ia, such as investigating the mechanisms of erythropoiesis defects caused by Cdan1-deficiency, the molecular pathology underlying the TEM phenotype in CDA-Ia erythroblasts, and the therapeutic effect of IFN-α.}

abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) originate from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs at masses approaching the Chandrasekhar limit, and are widely used as standard candles for cosmological distances. However, the progenitor system and explosion mechanism of SNe Ia are still unclear. The circumstellar environment of SNe Ia has received increasing attention in recent decades. The distance and other geometric properties of the circumstellar material provide essential clues for exploring the physical origin of SNe Ia. At the same time, the scattering of circumstellar dust can produce observable effects on the light curve, spectrum, and polarization during the late phase of SNe Ia. The spectroscopically normal SNe Ia can be classified into two categories: normal-velocity and high-velocity ones. The high-velocity SNe Ia have an apparent blue excess within a few months after the maximum brightness. This blue excess can be fitted by circumstellar dust scattering. Meanwhile, fitting the late-phase spectrum or imaging polarization of SNe Ia can constrain the grain size or the geometric distribution of circumstellar dust, respectively. The result indicates that multi-epoch image polarimetry during the late phase of SNe Ia is a crucial probe to reveal the characteristics of circumstellar dust.}

In the current study, an ELISA format was developed for affinity purification of human anti-IA-2ic autoantibodies utilizing a fusion protein (FP) incorporating maltose binding protein and the full-length IA-2IC domain. Using a T1D patient cohort validated for anti-IA-2ic autoantibodies by commercial ELISA, we demonstrate the MBP-IA-2ic FP ELISA detects serum anti-IA-2IC autoantibodies from 3 of 9 IA-2 positive patients. Further to this, a multi-plate MBP-IA-2ic FP ELISA protocol specifically affinity purifies IgG enriched for anti-IA-2ic autoantibodies. Interestingly, serum derived autoantibodies immobilised on the MBP-IA-2ic FP ELISA demonstrate increased Kappa light chain usage when compared to the respective total IgG derived from donor patients, suggesting a clonally restricted repertoire of anti-IA-2ic autoantigen specific B plasma cells is responsible for autoantibodies detect by the MBP-IA-2ic FP ELISA. This study is the first to demonstrate the generation of specific, genuine human derived anti-IA-2ic autoantibodies, thereby facilitating further investigation into the origin and functional significance of IA-2 autoantibodies in T1D.}

Maximal dye removal was achieved within first 90 min. Findings of kinetic and isothermal modeling confirmed fitness of results to pseudo second kinetic model, Freundlich as well as Temkin model correspondingly. Thermally, the process was spontaneous and exothermic showing feasibility with increase in temperature.

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
This study aimed to investigate the association of clinical, imaging, and pathological-molecular characteristics with the prediction of patient prognosis with stage IA invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILADC) after sub-lobar resection.
Materials and Methods
This study assessed 360 patients, including 91 and 269 with and without recurrence 3 years postoperatively, respectively, with stage IA ILADC undergoing preoperative chest computed tomography (CT) scans and subsequent sub-lobar resection at our institution. Their clinical and CT features and histological subtypes and gene mutation status were compared. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent risk factors for recurrence. An external validation cohort included 113 patients, used to test the model’s efficiency.
Results
For clinical features, old age, male gender, smokers, and high age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) were frequently observed in patients with recurrence than those without (all p < 0.05). For CT features, large tumor size, solid-predominant density, spiculation, peripheral fibrosis, type II pleural tag, and pleural adhesion were more common in recurrent patients than non-recurrent ones (all p < 0.05). The regression model revealed old age, large tumor size, solid-predominant density, spiculation, type II pleural tag, and pleural adhesion as independent risk factors for recurrence, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.942. The external validation cohort obtained an AUC of 0.958. For phological-molecular features, micropapillary/solid-predominant growth pattern, KRAS, ALK, and NRAS mutation or fusion were more common in the recurrent group, whereas EGFR mutation was more frequent in the non-recurrent group (all p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Clinical and CT features help predict the prognosis of patients with stage IA ILADC after sub-lobar resection and decide for individualized treatment. Moreover, patients with different prognosis demonstrated different pathological-molecular features.}

To begin, differences in distance modulus between models that include dark energy and those that do not were derived based on the assumption of dark energy’s existence. Next, calculations were made on how the absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia at different redshifts change with variations in the speed of light. Results indicate that a decrease in the speed of light with increasing redshift could account for the observed dimming of SNe Ia without requiring the introduction of dark energy. Furthermore, estimates suggest that the time required for the speed of light to increase by 1 m/s in the current universe would be less than 186 years.}

Among the most noticeable ones, the tension in the Hubble constant H0 is particularly intriguing, prompting a wide range of possible solutions. In the present work, the flat scale-free cosmology (S CDM) of Maeder (2017) is tested for H0 tension in fits to the Pantheon sample of Supernovae Ia. The Pantheon sample is a collection of 1048 SNe Ia, which formally defines H0 = H(0) by extrapolation to redshift zero of data over positive redshifts z > 0. Here, we consider H0,k in fits of S CDM over k equally sized bins of sub-samples of mean redshift zk. To quantify a trend in H0,k with zk, the results are fit by f(z)=H0′/(1+z)α in the two parameters H0′ and α. This approach tests for model imperfections or data biases by trends that are inconsistent with zero. Our findings show a decreasing trend inconsistent with zero at 5.3σ significance, significantly more so than in ΛCDM. These results are further confirmed in Pantheon+. It appears that a solution to H0 tension is to be found in models with a deceleration parameter q0 < q0,Λ below that of ΛCDM, rather than q0,Λ < q0,S < 0 satisfied by S CDM.}

The near-intronless genome of the kinetoplastid Leishmania exhibits polycistronic transcription which can facilitate R-loop formation. Therefore, to prevent such DNA-RNA hybrids, Leishmania has retained prokaryotic-like DNA Topoisomerase IA (LdTOPIA) in the course of evolution. LdTOPIA is an essential enzyme that is expressed ubiquitously and is adapted for the compartmentalized eukaryotic form in harboring functional bipartite nuclear localization signals. Although exhibiting greater homology to mycobacterial TOPIA, LdTOPIA could functionally complement the growth lethality of Escherichia coli TOPIA null GyrB ts strain at non-permissive temperatures. Purified LdTOPIA exhibits Mg2+-dependent relaxation of only negatively supercoiled DNA and preference towards single-stranded DNA substrates. LdTOPIA prevents nuclear R-loops as conditional LdTOPIA downregulated parasites exhibit R-loop formation and thereby parasite killing. The clinically used tricyclic antidepressant, norclomipramine could specifically inhibit LdTOPIA and lead to R-loop formation and parasite elimination. This comprehensive study therefore paves an avenue for drug repurposing against Leishmania.}

This study involved re-N-acetylation of CPS Ia to improve its biological functionality. The structural modifications and enhanced antigenicity of CPS Ia were observed after re-N-acetylation. The tetanus toxoid (TT) was conjugated with either partially de-N-acetylated or fully re-N-acetylated CPS. As a result, the conjugate containing re-N-acetylated CPS (IaReN-TT) enhanced the induction of IgG antibody levels and functional antibodies in mice.

To determine the most effective diagnostic markers and their associated thresholds for Ground-glass nodules (GGN) for identification of invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) and non-IA (including atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)), and to explore the application in preoperative surgical evaluation.
Methods and methods
A total of 126 cases, confirmed by pathology, were retrospectively analyzed. 70 cases were classified as the IA group, while the non-IA group consisted of cases of AAH, AIS, and MIA, with a total of 56 cases. The study compared the differences in demographic, morphological, and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative parameters between the two groups.
Results
There were statistically significant differences in various signs such as air bronchogram, lobulation, pleural indentation, spiculation, shape, and margin between the two groups. Additionally, Statistical significance was observed in all 3D quantitative parameters for both groups. Notably, when 3D volume of lesions exceeded 447 mm3, the sensitivity to predict IA was 81% with specificity at 69%. Utilizing multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was identified that the independent predictive value in discriminating between IA and non-IA lies with both the 3D volume and solid proportion. Combining these two indexes significantly improved the prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.826).
Conclusions
Reasonable utilization of 3D visualization technology can effectively aid in distinguishing between IA and non-IA. When coupled with clinical data and CT signs, this technique holds vital importance in directing the evaluation of surgical interventions prior to surgery.}

abstract = {In eukaryotes, pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) 3′-end processing is vital for gene expression and mRNA biogenesis; any awry in this pre-mRNA processing has detrimental effects and causes various diseases in humans. Pre-mRNA processing is coordinated via complex multi-protein machinery involving over 20 protein factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Endonucleolytic cleavage at the pre-mRNA 3′-end followed by poly(A) tail addition at the newly generated 3′-end requires CF IA, CPF, CF IB and other sequence elements. Among these essential proteins, Clp1 of the CF IA sub-unit is indispensable for the effective functioning of 3′-end processing machinery. Clp1, a conserved protein, is proposed to interlink 3′-end processing, transcriptional elongation and transcription termination. However, experimental evidence defining the precise roles played by Clp1, its interacting partners from other subunits and information about its exact mechanism of action during pre-mRNA processing is lacking. The current study details on the Clp1 N-terminal domain's (1–100 amino acids referred to as Clp11–100) successful cloning, expression and characterization using numerous biophysical techniques like circular dichroism and mass spectrometry etc. This information would open new frontiers to decipher the structure and molecular role of Clp1 during pre-mRNA maturation.}

Pathologic visceral pleural invasion (VPI) in patients with early-stage lung cancer can result in the upstaging of T1 to T2, in addition to having implications for surgical resection and prognostic outcomes. This study was designed with the goal of establishing and validating a CT-based deep learning (DL) model capable of predicting VPI status and stratifying patients based on their prognostic outcomes. In total, 2077 patients from three centers with pathologically confirmed clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled. DL signatures were extracted with a 3D residual neural network. DL model was able to effectively predict VPI status. VPI predicted by the DL models, as well as pathologic VPI, was associated with shorter disease-free survival. The established deep learning signature provides a tool capable of aiding the accurate prediction of VPI in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, thus enabling prognostic stratification.}

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown controversies about whether sublobar resection or lobectomy is the optimal surgical approach today. In this sense, this meta-analysis aims to compare these techniques. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sublobar resection with lobectomy for stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and reporting any of the following outcomes: (1) Overall survival (OS); (2) disease-free survival (DFS); and (3) total disease recurrences. Sublobar resection encompassed wedge resection and segmentectomy techniques. A total of 1975 patients from four studies were included, of whom 978 (49.5%) underwent sublobar resection and 973 (49.3%) were male. All tumors were smaller than 2 cm. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 7.3 years. Mean age was 62.8 ± 37.0 years, and 1353 (68.5%) patients had a known smoking history. OS (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.60–1.05; p = 0.11) and DFS (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.86–1.22; p = 0.80) did not significantly differ between the sublobar resection and lobectomy groups. Similarly, no significant statistical difference was observed in total disease recurrences (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.93–1.46; p = 0.17). Subgroup and isolated sublobar resection techniques analyses were not possible due to the lack of data. Sublobar resection and lobectomy have similar OS, DFS, and disease recurrence rates for stage IA NSCLC. These findings underline the need for new RCTs investigating these outcomes in specific patient subgroups and isolated sublobar resection techniques.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT

The mortality rate of infectious diseases caused by Achromobacter mucicolens is increasing. The enhanced antibiotic resistance among bacterial species through genetic transfer and mutations in the efflux mediating genes has made the treatment quite challenging. A. mucicolens is an aerobic, gram-negative, and non-fermenting opportunistic pathogen found in immunocompromised patients. A. mucicolens shows resistance against beta-lactams and other antibiotics through intrinsic resistance mechanisms, including multi-drug efflux pumps and beta-lactamases. In this study, the clinical isolate whole genome sequencing of A. mucicolens data was analyzed to identify the genes and mutations responsible for antimicrobial resistance. The identified genes and their mutants were then subjected to structural analysis to better understand the impact of mutations on the protein structure, and domain analysis was performed to investigate the role of domains in antibiotic resistance. A total of 4 genes, acrR, macB, msbA, and tolC, were identified with significant mutations, whereas macB was shortlisted for further analysis based on the conserved regions, sequence alignment, and the maximum number of mutations. All the mutants of the macB gene contain the two common domains, the ABC transporter-like ATP-binding domain and the AAA + ATPase domain. These domains are crucial in efflux mediating drug transport and can be targeted to design novel drugs for treating infections caused by A. mucicolens. IMPORTANCE Achromobacter species represent a significant threat as opportunistic pathogens, particularly in healthcare settings. Their resilience to antibiotics, demonstrated by strains like A. mucicolens, poses a serious challenge in treating infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. This study emphasizes the critical need for heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals regarding Achromobacter infections. By analyzing the whole genome sequencing data of A. mucicolens, the study sheds light on the genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance, aiding in more targeted treatment strategies. Furthermore, structural and domain analyses offer insights into how mutations impact protein structure and function, crucial for developing effective interventions. Ultimately, implementing rigorous sanitation measures and antibiotic stewardship protocols is needed to mitigate the spread of Achromobacter and safeguard vulnerable patient populations.

Current study reflects simplest procedure to synthesize IA-AuNPs. Its MTT and cytotoxicity assay was evaluated in HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 69.62 ± 5 µg/ml after 24 h of incubation. Apoptosis was done using ROS/, MMP and live-dead cell examination using AO/EtBr staining. In spectrophotometric analysis a single peak was observed at 542 nm which represents the SPR absorption band of gold nanoparticles. The IA-AuNPs were spherical with 5–40 nm size, with an average size of 10 nm, based on HR-TEM and HR-SEM. The existence of gold in IA-AuNPs was confirmed by EDX data. FTIR confirmed presence of various bioactive compounds in IA-AuNPs, with peaks at 3344cm−1, 2897cm−1, 2168cm−1, 1765cm−1, 1640cm−1, and 1275cm−1 corresponding to the-OH group and stretches of CH, C = H, C = O, and CO, respectively. At pH9 and 5Msalt concentration, significant stability of IA-AuNPs was observed. The zeta (ζ) potential value of IA-AuNPs at 25 °C and pH9 was -37.7 mV, showing its good quality and greater stability compared to pH6 and pH7 having zeta (ζ) potential value of -13.1 mV and -20.2 mV respectively. IA-AuNPs exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, and ROS/MMP mediated apoptosis assay. DPPH radical scavenging activities was measured at 517 nm in respect to ascorbic acid in which IA-AuNPs exhibited stronger antioxidant properties than plant extract. Overall, our results suggested that IA-AuNPs have anticancer/ antioxidant properties that may be useful for the treatment of hepatic cancer as future drug.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aims to explore the diagnostic performance of amide proton transfer (APT) imaging combined with diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in differentiating stage Ia endometrial carcinoma (EC) and endometrial polyps (EP).
Methods
All patients were scanned with APT and DKI sequences with 3.0 T MRI before surgery. The MRI data of 32 patients with histopathologically confirmed stage Ia EC and 17 patients with EP were retrospectively analyzed. Amide proton transfer, mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were measured. ROC curves were employed to evaluate the efficiency of differentiating and diagnosing stage Ia EC and EP, followed by the Delong test to compare the differences between the areas under the curve (AUCs) of each parameter. Additionally, the Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlation between APT values and MK and MD.
Results
The measured APT, MK, and MD values of the patients with stage Ia EC were 2.609 ± 0.504%,0.641 ± 0.113 and 0.904(0.816, 1.108) μm2/ms, while those of patients with EP were1.909 ± 0.418%, 0.495 ± 0.069, and 1.650 (1.458, 1.815) μm2/ms. The AUCs of APT, MK, MD, MK + MD, and APT + MK + MD in differentiating stage Ia EC and EP were.850, 0.879, 0.893, 0.930 and 0.976, respectively. The AUCs of APT + MK + MD were significantly higher than the AUCs of APT or MK (P < 0.05). The APT value was weakly and positively correlated with the MK value (r = 0.299, P = 0.037), while the APT value was moderately and negatively correlated with the MD value (r = −0.520, P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Both APT and DKI effectively differentiated stage Ia EC and EP; however, when combined, APT and DKI improved the ability to differentiate these diseases, boosting the value of using a combination of these modalities in clinical applications.}

This research investigates the influence of FA on the early-age shrinkage of cement paste under various wind speeds. The corresponding changes in pore structure were tested using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and backscattered electron image analysis (BSE-IA). The results show that under wind speed conditions, FA is not effective in reducing early-age shrinkage of cement paste. In fact, high levels of FA content can increase shrinkage values under wind speed conditions. Both wind speed and FA increase water evaporation, but they have different impact times. Although both wind speed and FA decrease mesopore content below 50 nm and increase water evaporation, they have opposite effects on early-age shrinkage. This suggests that mesopore content and water evaporation alone cannot fully characterize the change trend of early drying shrinkage. The two-factor parameter rs, which combines water evaporation and MIP-based pore size distribution, can effectively characterize drying shrinkage trends under the combined effects of wind speed and FA. BSE-IA can intuitively characterize pore size distribution above 200 nm, while the results of MIP underestimate the distribution of large capillary pores. Therefore, the current rs obtained based on MIP may be smaller than the actual value. With the advancement of testing technology in the future, rs can be further optimized.}

Aesculus wilsonii Rehd.'s dried mature seeds are the source of escin, a significant triterpenoid saponin. Aesculus wilsonii Rehd was first mentioned in the Compendium of Materia Medica, according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. It possesses the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory as well as treating gastrointestinal disorders. Escin Ia is the primary active component of escin, exhibiting significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that escin exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities beneficial for the protection against gastrointestinal diseases.
Aim of the study
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can be managed through pharmacological treatment; however, it features a high recurrence rate as well as propensity for complications. Therefore, reducing the rate of recurrence and improving the recurrence symptoms should be the primary focus of clinical prevention and treatment. Therefore, this research aims to study the effects of escin Ia on inflammation as well as oxidative stress in mice with chronic UC and to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying its potential to improve recurrent symptoms in UC mice.
Materials and methods
A mouse model of colitis produced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was developed for in vivo studies. A model of inflammation was created in vitro using caco-2 cells that were generated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through the observation of colitis symptoms and histological morphology in mice, the protective effect of escin Ia against colitis was ascertained. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and biochemical kits were then harnessed to measure the levels of oxidative stress markers as well as inflammatory factors. Additionally, to identify the possible target and molecular mechanism of escin Ia, qRT-PCR and western blotting, immunofluorescence, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics modeling were employed.
Results
We demonstrated that escin Ia remarkably improved the colitis symptoms as well as histological features of DSS-treated mice, lowered the levels of proinflammatory cytokines as well as oxidative stress biomarkers, and subsequently restored the permeability of the intestinal mucosa. Additionally, high expression of LOXL2 significantly reduced the protective effects of escin Ia in both inflamed mice and Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, escin Ia exhibited a strong binding affinity and notable stability with LOXL2.
Conclusion
Escin Ia inhibits inflammation and oxidative stress through the LOXL2/MMP-9 pathway, thereby restoring intestinal mucosal barrier function. Improved recurrent symptoms in mice with enteritis.}

BALB/c mice (4 mice per group) received individual intraperitoneal injections of 100 μl containing specific bacterial inoculum concentrations (ranging from 105 to 109 CFU per mouse) of Chinese and Pakistani GBS isolates (serotypes Ia and II). Control groups received 100 μL of sterile PBS. Results revealed that the LD50 bacterial dose causing 50 % mortality in mice was 107 CFU. The highest bacterial load in all experimental groups was quantified in the peritoneum, followed by blood, mammary gland, liver, spleen, lungs, and brain. The most significant bacterial dissemination was observed in mice inoculated with Pakistani serotype Ia at 24 h, with a subsequent notable decline in bacterial counts at day 3. Notably, infection with Pakistani serotype Ia showed a trend of increased total leukocyte counts, significantly higher than Pakistani serotype II, Chinese Serotype Ia, and Chinese serotype II. A substantial influx of neutrophils and lymphocytes was observed in response to all tested serotypes, with Pakistani serotype Ia inducing a significantly higher influx compared to other groups (Pakistani serotype II, Chinese serotype Ia, and Chinese serotype II). Furthermore, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-6 expressions were significantly increased in mice one day after infection with the Pakistani serotype Ia. Compared to mice infected with the Pakistani serotype II, Chinese Serotype Ia, and Chinese serotype II, those infected with the Pakistani serotype Ia isolate exhibited the highest production of IL-10 and TGF-β, along with significantly increased concentrations of lactoferrin, albumin, and MPO. These findings suggest that the persistence and severity of infection caused by the Pakistani serotype Ia may be linked to its ability to spread to deeper tissues. This study enhances our understanding of the clinical characteristics of bovine mastitis caused by S. agalactiae in China and Pakistan.}

abstract = {Background
This study compares sublobar resections—wedge resection and segmentectomy—in clinical stage IA lung cancers. It tests the hypothesis that overall survival after wedge resection is similar to segmentectomy.
Methods
Adults undergoing wedge resection or segmentectomy for clinical stage IA lung cancer were identified from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database. Eligible patients were linked to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database using a matching algorithm. The primary outcome was long-term overall survival. Propensity scores overlap weighting (PSOW) adjustment of wedge resection using validated covariates was used for group difference mitigation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models analyzed survival. All-cause first readmission, and morbidity and mortality were examined using PSOW regression models.
Results
Of 9756 patients, 6141 met inclusion criteria, comprising 2154 segmentectomies and 3987 wedge resections. PSOW reduced differences between the groups. Unadjusted perioperative mortality was comparable, but wedge resection showed lower major morbidity rates. Weighted regression analysis indicated reduced mortality and major morbidity risks in wedge resection. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no mortality difference between groups, which was confirmed by PSOW Cox regression models. The cumulative risk of readmission was also comparable for both groups, with Cox Fine-Gray models showing no difference in rehospitalization risks.
Conclusions
In clinical stage IA lung cancer, relative to segmentectomy, wedge resection has comparable overall survival and lower perioperative morbidity, suggesting it is an equally effective option for the broader population of patients with clinical stage IA lung cancer, not only those at highest risk of complications.}

Rapid identification of MPXV and differentiation of its clades and subclades are crucial for effective control of the disease. In this study, we developed an ARMS-Quadruplex-qPCR method to detect MPXV and distinguish clades (Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb). F3L gene was used to detect all clades of MPXV from other orthopoxviruses. A 1953 bp fragment containing the C3L gene was found to be completely absent in clade II. Additionally, a sequence spanning from the 177th to the 1318th position (1142 bp) within the 1953 bp fragment was missing in Ib. Therefore, the 1142 bp sequence was used to distinguish Ia from other subclades, and the sequence with the 1142 bp region missing in Ib was used to discriminate Ib from other subclades. Since subclades IIa and IIb are too close to have large deletions and insertions, a unique single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was used to design a primer/probe set for ARMS-qPCR to differentiate clade IIa from IIb. The ARMS-Quadruplex-qPCR system can detect down to 2 copies per reaction of MPXV and effectively differentiate all the four subclades. Altogether, four qPCR primer/probe sets in one tube were deployed to recognize MPXV and differentiate MPXV subclades. The high sensitivity, rapidity and specificity of the developed system make it a promising alternative for the diagnosis of MPXV and the determination of the subclades of the infected MPXV.}

The presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) influences the management and outcomes of patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. The objective was the development of a deep learning (DL) signature for the prediction of LVI and stratification of prognosis.
Methods
A total of 2077 patients from three centers were retrospectively enrolled and divided into a training set (n = 1515), an internal validation set (n = 381), and an external set (n = 181). A -three-dimensional residual neural network was used to extract the DL signature and three models, namely, the clinical, DL, and combined models, were developed. Diagnostic efficiency was assessed by ROC curves and AUC values. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to evaluate links between various factors and disease-free survival.
Results
The DL model could effectively predict LVI, shown by AUC values of 0.72 (95 %CI: 0.68–0.76) and 0.63 (0.54–0.73) in the internal and external validation sets, respectively. The incorporation of DL signature and clinical-radiological factors increased the AUC to 0.74 (0.71–0.78) and 0.77 (0.70–0.84) in comparison with the DL and clinical models (AUC of 0.71 [0.68–0.75], 0.71 [0.61–0.81]) in the internal and external validation sets, respectively. Pathologic LVI, LVI predicted by both DL and combined models were associated with unfavorable prognosis (all p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The effectiveness of the DL signature in the diagnosis of LVI and prognosis prediction in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma was demonstrated. These findings suggest the potential of the model in clinical decision-making.}

During the last decades, the SNe Ia samples have been improved in number, redshift coverage, calibration methodology, and systematics treatment. These efforts led to the most recent “Pantheon” (2018) and “Pantheon +” (2022) releases, which enable to constrain cosmological parameters more precisely than previous samples. In this era of precision cosmology, the community strives to find new ways to reduce uncertainties on cosmological parameters. To this end, we start our investigation even from the likelihood assumption of Gaussianity, implicitly used in this domain. Indeed, the usual practice involves constraining parameters through a Gaussian distance moduli likelihood. This method relies on the implicit assumption that the difference between the distance moduli measured and the ones expected from the cosmological model is Gaussianly distributed. In this work, we test this hypothesis for both the Pantheon and Pantheon + releases. We find that in both cases this requirement is not fulfilled and the actual underlying distributions are a logistic and a Student's t distribution for the Pantheon and Pantheon + data, respectively. When we apply these new likelihoods fitting a flat ΛCDM model, we significantly reduce the uncertainties on the matter density ΩM and the Hubble constant H0 of ∼40%. As a result, the Hubble tension is increased at >5σ level. This boosts the SNe Ia power in constraining cosmological parameters, thus representing a huge step forward to shed light on the current debated tensions in cosmology.}

abstract = {Background
Surgical resection is the gold standard treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Prior studies have found that delayed treatment carries risk of disease progression. However, factors that predict delay to surgery are relatively understudied. The aim of this study was to identify characteristics associated with time to surgery.
Methods
The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with stage IA-IIIA NSCLC who underwent upfront resection from 2017 to 2021. The primary outcome was time to surgery examined as a continuous and categorical variable in which patients were divided into timely (≤6 weeks) and delayed (>6 weeks) surgery cohorts.
Results
Across 75,047 patients, the median time to surgery was 41 days (interquartile range, 19-64 days). Of these patients, 39,685 (52.9%) were in the timely cohort and 35,362 (47.1%) were in the delayed cohort. After risk adjustment, significant predictors of increased odds of delayed surgery included African-American race (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.34-1.59), lack of insurance (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.33-2.17), lower educational status (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25]), lower household income (OR, 1.40; 95% CI,1.28-1.54), and use of a robotic-assisted approach (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.15-1.27). Patients whose surgery was delayed had significantly increased risk-adjusted odds of upstaging (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.28), 30-day mortality (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02-1.52), and 90-day mortality (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.45]).
Conclusions
After risk adjustment for oncologic characteristics, sociodemographic factors are associated with delay to definitive surgery in NSCLC and subsequent increased odds of mortality and pathologic upstaging. Future work should explore strategies to improve availability and accessibility of timely treatment for these patient populations to ameliorate disparities in care for NSCLC.}

abstract = {Objectives
We evaluated the clinicopathological and oncological characteristics of epidermal growth factor receptor–mutated clinical stage IA radiological pure-solid lung adenocarcinoma and compared them with those of a ground-glass opacity component.
Methods
Between 2008 and 2020, data from 1014 surgically resected clinical stage 0-IA epidermal growth factor receptor–mutated lung adenocarcinomas were evaluated. Oncological outcomes were assessed using multivariable analysis. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log-rank test. The cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated using the Gray's test.
Results
Of these, 233 (23%) were radiologically pure-solid tumors, which demonstrated a higher proportion of nodal metastasis, micropapillary component, spread through alveolar space, and Ex19 subtype compared with those of tumors with ground-glass opacity (P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that the presence of ground-glass opacity was an independently significant factor for overall survival (P = .037) and cumulative incidence of recurrence (P < .001). In cases where the oncological outcomes were stratified by the presence of ground-glass opacity component, the 5-year overall survival was excellent at more than 90% in tumors with ground-glass opacity despite clinical-T categories (P = .2044); however, tumor size significantly affected survival only in pure-solid tumors (T1a, 100%; T1b, 77.7%; T1c, 68.5%; P = .0056). Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of recurrence was low in tumors with ground-glass opacity despite the clinical-T categories, whereas tumor size significantly affected the cumulative incidence of recurrence only in pure-solid tumors (5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence: T1a-b, 18.9%; T1c, 41.3%; P < .001).
Conclusions
Oncologic behavior and prognosis of radiologically pure-solid tumors were significantly poorer than those of tumors with ground-glass opacity among patients with epidermal growth factor receptor–mutated early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. These findings imply distinct tumorigenesis based on the presence of ground-glass opacity, even in tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations.}

To solve this problem, polyacrylonitrile-co-itaconic acid (PAN-co-IA) copolymer was prepared as matrix, tannic acid (TA) encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) named as CNTs@TA was used as nano-modifier to design the PAN-co-IA/CNTs@TA composite flat membrane by the non-solvent-induced phase separation technique. The copolymerization of IA improved the hydrophilicity of PAN, in addition, the hydrogen bonding formation between IA and TA on the surface of CNTs ensured the stable existence of CNTs@TA particles in the composite membrane. At the same time, the π-π bonds between TA and CNTs avoided the loss of TA during the wastewater separation process. The introduction of IA, TA, and CNTs endowed the PAN-co-IA/CNTs@TA composite membrane with excellent hydrophilicity and double-layer finger pore structure, which achieved its high pure water flux of 3102.63 Lm-2h-1. What's more, the PAN-co-IA/CNTs@TA composite membrane behaved large flux (>1600 Lm-2h-1) and high retention (>97 %) for various cationic dye wastewater based on the electrostatic adsorption mechanism. In addition, the high hydrophilicity and the reinforcing effect of CNTs endowed PAN-co-IA/CNTs@TA membrane with excellent cycling stability.

abstract = {Introduction
Treatment with adjuvant osimertinib for three years is the standard-of-care for resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. The role of neoadjuvant osimertinib in the perioperative setting is yet to be elucidated in the NeoADAURA study (NCT04351555).
Methods
This is a single-center, pilot study of patients with clinical stage IA to IIIA NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition) harboring an activating EGFR mutation (Exon 19 deletion, L858R) (NCT04816838). Patients were treated with two 28-day cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib followed by surgical resection and three years of adjuvant osimertinib. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate after two cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Secondary endpoints included the pathologic complete response rate and major pathologic response rate. Exploratory objectives included the correlation of longitudinal circulating tumor DNA testing (Signatera) and response to neoadjuvant osimertinib.
Results
A total of 25 patients were enrolled and treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib, and all patients received surgical resection with R0 resection. The objective response rate was 44% (n = 11) all of which were partial responses. Fourteen patients (56%) reported stable disease after neoadjuvant osimertinib. The major pathologic response and pathologic complete response rates were 24% (n = 6) and 0%, respectively. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median disease-free survival was not reached at a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 13.8–38.6 mo). Six patients (30%) were circulating tumor DNA–positive at baseline and achieved clearance after 1 cycle of neoadjuvant osimertinib. There were no grade 3 adverse events during neoadjuvant treatment.
Conclusions
Two cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib did not meet its primary endpoint of ORR. Neoadjuvant osimertinib is a feasible approach with a manageable safety profile in resectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC.}

This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models utilizing positron emission tomography (PET)-habitat of the tumor and its peritumoral microenvironment to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with clinical stage IA pure-solid non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Materials and Methods
234 Patients who underwent lung resection for NSCLC from two hospitals were reviewed. Radiomic features were extracted from both intratumoral, peritumoral and habitat regions on PET. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to determine significant clinical variables. Subsequently, a radiomics nomogram was developed by combining the radiomics signature with these identified clinical variables. Kaplan–Meier (KM) analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic value of the nomogram. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the ML models.
Results
The combination model which contained peritumoral 5 mm and habitat regions radiomics features, clinical variables obtained a strong well-performance, achieving area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.854–0.957) in the train set and 0.875 (95% CI 0.789–0.962) in the internal validation set. The radiomics signature was significantly associated with PFS, the model significantly discerned high and low-risk patients, and exhibited a significant benefit in the clinical use showed low-risk score given have far longer RFS than those with high-risk score (log-rank P＜0.001).
Conclusion
The habitat and peritumoral radiomics signatures serve as an independent biomarker for predicting PFS in patients with early-stage NSCLC, effectively stratified survival risk among patients with clinical stage IA pure-solid non-small cell lung cancer.}

abstract = {Background
It remains undetermined whether preoperative computed tomography (CT)-guided hookwire localization would result in elevated risk of tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma.
Methods
A total of 1836 patients who underwent lobectomy were included. To eliminate the potential impact of confounding factors on producing STAS, propensity score–matching (PSM) was used to create two balanced subgroups stratified by implementation of hookwire localization. We also introduced an external cohort including 1486 patients to explore the effect of hookwire localization on the incidence of STAS and patient survival after sublobar resection (SR). For proactive simulation of hookwire localization, 20 consecutive lobectomy specimens of p-stage IA lung adenocarcinoma were selected.
Results
Ex vivo tests revealed that mechanical artifacts presenting as spreading through a localizer surface (STALS) could be induced by hookwire localization but be distinguished by CD68 and AE1/3 antibody-based immunohistochemistry. The distance of STALS dissemination tended to be shorter compared with real STAS (P = 0.000). After PSM, implementation of hookwire localization was not associated with elevated STAS incidence, nor worse survival in p-stage IA patients undergoing lobectomy irrespective of STAS.
Conclusions
CT-guided hookwire localization might induce mechanical artifacts presenting as STALS which could be distinguished by immunohistochemistry, but would not affect survival in p-stage IA disease. Surgeons can be less apprehensive about performing hookwire localization in relation to STAS on stage IA disease suitable for SR.}

abstract = {Galloylated catechins are the dominant bioactive metabolites in tea leaves and have a great impact on tea flavor quality and human health. Trihelix transcription factors are known to perform essential functions in regulating multiple plant developmental processes and environmental responses. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of Trihelix members in modulating tea plant galloylated catechin biosynthesis remains obscure. Here, the Trihelix transcription factor CsGT1A was identified as a candidate gene involved in tea plant galloylated catechin biosynthesis via a genome-wide association study. CsGT1A transcription showed significantly positive correlations with galloylated catechin content. Overexpression of CsGT1A significantly increased galloylated catechin content and upregulated the expression of serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferase gene CsSCPL11-IA, the key structural gene in the downstream path of galloylated catechin biosynthesis. Silencing of CsGT1A remarkably reduced galloylated catechin content and downregulated CsSCPL11-IA transcription. The CsSCPL11-IA transcription could be activated by CsGT1A through interacting with its promoter, evidenced by yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Light intensity-responsive gene expression analysis showed that CsGT1A transcription was significantly correlated with the transcription of most galloylated catechin biosynthesis-related genes, especially CsSCPL11-IA, as well as the contents of galloylated catechins, under different light intensities. Taken together, these results revealed that CsGT1A could promote galloylated catechin biosynthesis by directly activating CsSCPL11-IA, and CsGT1A-CsSCPL11-IA module is also involved in light intensity-regulated galloylated catechin biosynthesis. This study deepens our comprehension of the regulatory mechanism underlying galloylated catechin biosynthesis, and provides valuable information for the cultivation of high-quality tea plant cultivars.}

abstract = {Metacaspases are cysteine proteases belonging to the CD clan of the C14 family. They possess important characteristics, such as specificity for cleavage after basic residues (Arg/Lys) and dependence on calcium ions to exert their catalytic activity. They are defined by the presence of a large subunit (p20) and a small subunit (p10) and are classified into types I, II, and III. Type I metacaspases have a characteristic pro-domain at the N-terminal of the enzyme, preceding a region rich in glutamine and asparagine. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type I metacaspase is found. This organism encodes a single metacaspase that participates in the process of programmed cell death by apoptosis. The study focuses on cloning, expressing, and mutating Saccharomyces cerevisiae metacaspase (ScMCA-Ia). Mutations in Cys155 and Cys276 were introduced to investigate autoprocessing mechanisms. Results revealed that Cys155 plays a crucial role in autoprocessing, initiating a conformational change that activates ScMCA-Ia. Comparative analysis with TbMCA-IIa highlighted the significance of the N-terminal region in substrate access to the active site. The study proposes a two-step processing mechanism for type I metacaspases, where an initial processing step generates the active form, followed by a distinct intermolecular processing step. This provides new insights into ScMCA-Ia's activation and function. The findings hold potential implications for understanding cellular processes regulated by metacaspases. Overall, this research significantly advances knowledge in metacaspase biology.}

abstract = {Considerable evidence has verified that the micropapillary pattern is significantly associated with worse prognosis in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However, whether the presence of a micropapillary component in pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma is also related to worse prognosis remains unclear up to now. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the prognostic role of presence of a micropapillary component in pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients. Relevant studies were searched from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI databases and reviewed. The primary and secondary outcomes were the recurrence risk and long-term survival including the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. All statistical analysis were conducted by STATA 12.0 software. A total of 5257 lung adenocarcinoma patients at the pathological stage IA from ten retrospective studies were enrolled. The recurrence rates in pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients with and without the a micropapillary component were 32% [95% confidence interval (CI): 20%− 44%] and 7% (95% CI: 4%−10%) separately and pooled results indicated that presence of a micropapillary component was an obvious risk factor for recurrence [odds ratio (OR)= 3.41, 95% CI: 2.80–4.16, P＜0.001]. Besides, the presence of a micropapillary component was significantly related to poorer OS [hazard ratio (HR)= 2.44, 95% CI: 1.28–4.68, P = 0.007] and DFS (HR=2.60, 95% CI: 1.63–4.16, P＜0.001). Subgroup analysis focusing on invasive adenocarcinoma manifested consistent results. In pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, the presence of a micropapillary component predicts obviously higher recurrence risk and worse prognosis even after focusing on invasive adenocarcinoma. However, more prospective high-quality studies are still needed to verify our findings.}

In this study, in vitro reaction of IA was obtained 72.44 g/L by using engineered E. coli Lemo21(DE3) harboring the aconitase (Acn, EC 4.2.1.3) and cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CadA, EC 4.1.1.6) which was cultured in glycerol-based minimal medium. IA productivity enhancement was observed after cold-treating the biocatalysts in − 80 °C for 24 h prior to the reaction, reaching 81.6 g/L. On the other hand, a new seeding strategy in Terrific Broth (TB) as a nutritionally rich medium was employed to maintain the biocatalysts stability up to 30 days. Finally, the highest IA titer of 98.17 g/L was attained using L21::7G chassis, that has a pLemo plasmid and integration of GroELS to the chromosome. The high-level of IA production along with the biocatalyst reutilization enables the economic viability toward a sustainable biorefinery.}

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthetize existing evidence and to compare the survival outcomes observed for stage IA NSCLC following segmentectomy or lobectomy. 40 studies (38 observational, 2 RCTs) encompassing 103,926 patients were analyzed. Primary outcomes included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local recurrences, harvested lymph nodes, postoperative morbidity, and length of hospital stay. Risk of bias was assessed using established tools, and evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE. Non-RCTs showed an OS HR of 1.10 (95 % CI: 0.94–1.30, p = 0.24) with low certainty, contrasting with RCTs’ HR of 0.82 (95 % CI: 0.66–1.02, p = 0.7) with moderate certainty. Local recurrences exhibited OR 1.40 (95 % CI: 0.94–2.08, p = 0.09) in non-RCTs with low certainty, and RR 1.61 (95 % CI: 1.12–2.31, p = 0.01) in RCTs with low certainty. Non-RCTs showed DFS HR 1.13 (95 % CI: 0.95–1.34, p = 0.18) with low certainty, while RCTs yielded HR 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.85–1.18, p = 0.97) with moderate certainty. Lobectomy resulted in more harvested lymph nodes. Postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay did not differ significantly. While definitive evidence for OS, DFS, and postoperative outcomes differences was inconclusive, a potential increase in local recurrences following lobectomy was noted. Further well-designed studies are warranted to enhance evidence and inform clinical practice in stage I lung cancer surgery.}

We attempted genome editing using two adeno-associated virus vectors, one that expressed Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 protein and a second containing a donor transgene encoding G6Pase, in a dog model for GSD Ia. We demonstrated donor transgene integration in the liver of three adult-treated dogs accompanied by stable G6Pase expression and correction of hypoglycemia during fasting. Two puppies with GSD Ia were treated by genome editing that achieved donor transgene integration in the liver. Integration frequency ranged from 0.5% to 1% for all dogs. In adult-treated dogs, anti-SaCas9 antibodies were detected before genome editing, reflecting prior exposure to S. aureus. Nuclease activity was low, as reflected by a low percentage of indel formation at the predicted site of SaCas9 cutting that indicated double-stranded breaks followed by non-homologous end-joining. Thus, genome editing can integrate a therapeutic transgene in the liver of a large animal model, either early or later in life, and further development is warranted to provide a more stable treatment for GSD Ia.}

In short, research ethics is the set of specific principles, rules, and norms of behavior that a research community has decided are appropriate and fair under the premise that research must be valid, reliable, legitimate, and representative. This non-systematic review brings some ethical concerns that should be considered within the scientific community.

They are also a vexing challenge, one that is exacerbated by the increased pressure many states are under to expedite the approval of projects deemed important for mitigating the climate crisis. In federalist countries like Canada, obstacles to implementing next-generation IA are amplified by divisions of powers among national, provincial (state) and other governments. In this paper, we consider a recent Supreme Court of Canada decision on the constitutionality of the federal Impact Assessment Act (IAA), a commitment by the Government of Canada to improve IA efficiency, and amendments to the IAA aimed at fixing constitutional issues and shortening timelines. We analyse the ability of the amended law to ensure effective attention to cumulative and interactive effects and contribute to sustainability while achieving desired efficiency gains. We conclude that while the changes to the IAA may undermine its ability achieve these goals, opportunities for advancing next generation assessment may be found in other key components of it, namely interjurisdictional collaboration and upward harmonization, respect for Indigenous knowledge, rights and authority, and more frequent and ambitious use of regional assessments.}

With the development of medical technology and change of life habits, early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has become more common. This study aimed to systematically analyzed clinicopathological factors associated to the overall survival (OS) of patients with Stage IA LUAD.
Methods
A total of 5942 Stage IA LUAD patients were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank tests were used to compare the differences in OS. A nomogram constructed based on the Cox regression was evaluated by Concordance index (C index), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and area under curve (AUC). And 136 patients were recruited from Shandong Province Hospital for external validation.
Results
Cox analysis regression indicated that 12 factors, such as Diagnosis to Treatment Interval (DTI) and Income Level, were independent prognostic factors and were included to establish the nomogram. The C-index of our novel model was 0.702, 0.724 and 0.872 in the training, internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year survival AUCs and calibration curves showed excellent agreement in each cohort. Some new factors in the SEER database, including DTI and Income Level, were firstly confirmed as independent prognostic factors of Stage IA LUAD patients. The distribution of these factors in the T1a, T1b, and T1c subgroups differed and had different effects on survival.
Conclusion
We summarized 12 factors that affect prognosis and constructed a nomogram to predict OS of Stage IA LUAD patients who underwent operation. For the first time, new SEER database parameters, including DTI and Income Level, were proved to be survival-related.}

Clinical stage IA non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showing a pure-solid appearance on computed tomography is associated with a worse prognosis. This study aimed to develop and validate machine-learning models using preoperative clinical and radiomic features to predict overall survival (OS) in clinical stage IA pure-solid NSCLC.
Methods
Patients who underwent lung resection for NSCLC between January 2012 and December 2020 were reviewed. The radiomic features were extracted from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions on computed tomography. The machine-learning models were developed using random survival forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, whereas the Cox regression model was set as a benchmark. Model performance was assessed using the integrated time-dependent area under the curve (iAUC) and validated by 5-fold cross-validation.
Results
In total, 642 patients with clinical stage IA pure-solid NSCLC were included. Among 3748 radiomic and 34 preoperative clinical features, 42 features were selected. Both machine-learning models outperformed the Cox regression model (iAUC, 0.753; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.629-0.829). The XGBoost model showed a better performance (iAUC, 0.832; 95% CI, 0.779-0.880) than the random survival forest model (iAUC, 0.795; 95% CI, 0.734-0.856). The XGBoost model showed an excellent survival stratification performance with a significant OS difference among the low-risk (5-year OS, 100.0%), moderate low-risk (5-year OS, 88.5%), moderate high-risk (5-year OS, 75.6%), and high-risk (5-year OS, 41.7%) groups (P < .0001).
Conclusions
A radiomics-based machine-learning model can preoperatively and accurately predict OS and improve survival stratification in clinical stage IA pure-solid NSCLC.}

abstract = {Circular structures made from woolly mammoth bones are found across Ukraine and west Russia, yet the origin of the bones remains uncertain. We present ten new mammoth radiocarbon dates from the largest circular structure at Kostenki 11-Ia, identifying two mammoth mandibles ∼200–1200 years older than the other dated materials from the site, suggesting skeletal material from long-dead individuals was scavenged and used in the site construction. Biomolecular sexing of 30 individuals showed a predominance of females, suggesting the Kostenki mammoths are primarily from herds. We identify seven mitochondrial lineages across 16 samples, and thus the mammoths are not all from the same matriline. Integrating biomolecular sexing with stable δ13C and δ15N isotope analysis, we find no isotopically-differentiated resource use by females and males, providing the first analysis of foraging differences between sexes in any Late Pleistocene megafauna. Our study highlights the significance of integrating ancient biomolecular approaches in archaeological inference.}

Rainbow trout immunized with rVHSV-IaGΔTM-IaG and rVHSV-IaGΔTM-IVaG showed significantly higher serum antibody titers against both VHSV Ia and VHSV IVa, and showed no mortality against VHSV Ia infection, while fish in the control groups showed 100% mortalities. Fish immunized with rVHSV-IaGΔTM-ihnvGΔTM-IVaG showed significantly higher serum antibody titers against VHSV IVa, VHSV Ia, and IHNV compared to fish in the control group. Immunization with rVHSV-IaGΔTM-ihnvGΔTM-IVaG induced significantly higher protection against not only VHSV Ia but also IHNV. These results suggest that the present single-cycle rVHSV-based system can be used as a platform to produce combined vaccines that can protect fish from multiple pathogenic species. However, the mechanism of the high protection against IHNV despite comparatively low antibody titer remains to be investigated.}

abstract = {Introduction: Decitabine is currently primarily used to treat elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and above or those who are intolerant to standard chemotherapy. To optimize the induction regimen for younger AML patients and explore the optimal use of decitabine, this study conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the combination of decitabine with the IA (DIA) regimen in newly diagnosed younger AML patients, furthermore, investigating the predictive value of BTG1 levels before and after treatment with decitabine combined with the IA regimen. Methods: This is a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial conducted across 4 hospitals from May 2019 to April 2024 (ChiCTR2000037928). This study employed a randomized controlled design to allocate newly diagnosed AML patients into experimental and control groups. Patients in the experimental group received DIA regimen, specifically decitabine at 20 mg/m2/day on days 1 to 5 along with IA regimen (cytarabine 100-200 mg/m2/day on days 4 to 10 and idarubicin 10 mg/m2/day on days 4 to 6). Patients in the control group received the IA regimen alone. Subsequently, a single-arm study employing a DIA regimen was conducted to investigate whether pre- and post-treatment levels of BTG1 can predict efficacy. The Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between BTG1 levels and efficacy outcomes. Results: This study included 106 evaluable newly diagnosed AML patients, with a gender ratio of 1:1.06 and a median age of 44 years. 55 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group, and 51 to the control group. There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in baseline characteristics except that the control group had significantly higher platelet counts at initial diagnosis compared to the experimental group (61.0 vs. 34.0, P =0.005). After one cycle of treatment, 44 patients (80.0%) in the experimental group achieved complete remission (CR) /CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and 9 patients (16.4%) achieved partial remission (PR), resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 96.4%. In the control group, 43 patients (84.3%) achieved CR/CRi, and 4 patients (7.8%) achieved PR, resulting in an ORR of 92.1%. Among patients achieving CR, 30 (68.2%) patients in the experimental group achieved deep remission (CRMRD-), which was higher than the 22 patients (51.2%) in the control group, though this difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in terms of hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (AEs). At the end of follow-up, in the experimental group and the control group, 31 (56.4%) and 38 (74.5%) patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (P＞0.05). In the experimental group, 42 patients (76.4%) were alive, compared to 42 patients (82.4%) in the control group. The two-year overall survival (OS) was 78.4% in the experimental group and 84.3% in the control group (P＞0.05). The two-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 75.5% in the experimental and 74.2% in the control groups(P＞0.05). Thirty-seven patients treated with DIA regimen were enrolled in a single-arm study to investigate whether BTG1 levels before and after treatment could predict efficacy. Pre-treatment levels of BTG1 are negatively correlated with achieving MRD negativity post-treatment (r=-0.285, P=0.039). Conclusion: In newly diagnosed non-elderly AML patients, receiving DIA regimen as an induction therapy did not significantly increase adverse reactions compared to the IA regimen alone, demonstrating good tolerability. The DIA regimen did not show clear advantages in terms of CR, OS, and RFS. However, DIA regimen shows a higher rate of achieving MRD-negative CR, providing a foundation for long-term survival in patients, yet the difference lacks statistical significance, indicating the need for further expansion of the sample size. Therefore, its clinical application in newly diagnosed non-elderly patients still requires sufficient clinical research evidence and personalized selection. Pre-treatment BTG1 levels predict the potential for achieving MRD negativity in patients treated with DIA regimen.}

abstract = {Rice sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA, is a major disease in rice-growing areas worldwide. Effectors of phytopathogenic fungi play important roles during the infection process of fungal pathogens onto their host plants. However, the molecular mechanisms by which R. solani effectors regulate rice immunity are not well understood. Through prediction, 78 candidate effector molecules were identified. Using the tobacco rattle virus-host induced gene silencing (TRV-HIGS) system, 45 RNAi constructs of effector genes were infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The results revealed that eight of these constructs resulted in a significant reduction in necrosis caused by infection with the AG1-IA strain GD-118. Additionally, stable rice transformants carrying the double-stranded RNA construct for one of the effector genes, AGLIP1, were generated to further verify the function of this gene. The suppression of the AGLIP1 gene increased the resistance of both N. benthamiana and rice against GD-118, and also affected the growth rate of GD-118, indicating that AGLIP1 is a key pathogenic factor. Small RNA sequencing showed that the HIGS vectors were processed into siRNAs within the plants and then translocated to the fungi, leading to the silencing of the target genes. As a result, AGLIP1 might be an excellent candidate for HIGS, thereby enhancing crop resistance against the pathogen and contributing to the control of R. solani infection.}

abstract = {Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)-linked hyperglycemia, along with their associated complications, have reached pandemic proportions, constituting a major public health issue. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of purine nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes has emerged as a potential strategy for treating diseases. We previously showed that cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (NT5C2)-deficient mice were protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance. This study investigated the effects of dual deletion of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidases IA (NT5C1A) and II (NT5C2) in mice. We found that NT5C1A/NT5C2 double-knockout (NT5C-dKO) mice exhibited mild hypoglycemia, associated with enhanced skeletal muscle insulin action and reduced hepatic glucose production. This phenotype was accompanied by liver and skeletal muscle proteomic alterations notably related to amino acid metabolism, besides the potential involvement of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our findings support the development of novel anti-diabetic treatments using small-molecule cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase inhibitors.}
