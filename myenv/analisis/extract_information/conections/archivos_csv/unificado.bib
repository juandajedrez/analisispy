An integrated velocity–density model based on a joint inversion of traveltimes and gravity data is presented for the crust and uppermost mantle along MONA LISA line 3, which crosses the Central Graben approximately perpendicular to its strike direction. This model shows pronounced crustal thinning and associated Moho uplift beneath the deepest part of the Central Graben. In the graben area, Moho is interpreted to be situated at 25km depth and the crystalline crust is about a factor of 2 thinner than in the surrounding crustal provinces, where Moho is interpreted to reach depths between 32 and 36km. Maximum thickness of the sedimentary column in the Central Graben is 10–11km. The mass deficit of the thick sediments is compensated by the Moho uplift. The modelled Moho coincides with the base of lower crustal reflectivity observed in the coincident normal-incidence seismic section. Good overall agreement between the integrated velocity–density model and the normal-incidence data is observed. The migrated deep seismic reflection section recorded to 26s traveltime contains deep west-ward and east-ward dipping events symmetric about the deepest part of the Central Graben. These dipping upper mantle reflections may be linked to extensional processes that formed the Central Graben. At least one of the upper mantle dipping reflectors may be a reactivated structure formed originally during Caledonian collision."

Over the years, there have been a number of debated topics on the painting, including the valence of the emotion expressed on her face. Nevertheless, the most recent interpretations agree that Mona Lisa expression is happiness. The smile asymmetry of Mona Lisa is another remarkable feature of the painting. We here asked forty-two healthy raters to judge which of the six basic emotions (or neutral expression) was expressed by the chimeric images of the left or right lower hemi face. We collected chosen responses, confidence levels and reaction times. Our results indicate that happiness is expressed only on the left side. According to some influent theories of emotion neuropsychology, we here interpreted the Mona Lisa asymmetric smile as a non-genuine smile, also thought to occur when the subject lies. Given that Leonardo was a great observer of human physiognomy we speculate on the intriguing possibility that Leonardo already knew the true meaning of asymmetric smile. Thus, Mona Lisa asymmetric smile could represent a stratagem Leonardo deliberately used to hold cryptic and enigmatic messages. Although the Mona Lisa smile continues to attract the attention of its observers, the true message it conveys remains elusive and many unsolved mysteries remain to be elucidated, perhaps via the knowledge of emotion neuropsychology."

    abstract = "As shown by the recent Mw 7.0 Haiti earthquake, intra-arc deformation, which accompanies the subduction process, can present seismic and tsunami hazards to nearby islands. Spatially-limited diffuse tectonic deformation within the Northeast Caribbean Plate Boundary Zone likely led to the development of the submerged Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. GPS geodetic data and a moderate to high level of seismicity indicate that extension within the region is ongoing. Newly-collected high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and multi-channel seismic reflection profiles and previously-collected samples are used here to determine the tectonic evolution of the Mona Passage intra-arc region. The passage is floored almost completely by Oligocene–Pliocene carbonate platform strata, which have undergone submarine and subaerial erosion. Structurally, the passage is characterized by W- to NNW-trending normal faults that offset the entire thickness of the Oligo–Pliocene carbonate platform rocks. The orientation of these faults is compatible with the NE-oriented extension vector observed in GPS data. Fault geometry best fits an oblique extension model rather than previously proposed single-phase, poly-phase, bending-moment, or rotation extension models. The intersection of these generally NW-trending faults in Mona Passage with the N–S oriented faults of Mona Canyon may reflect differing responses of the brittle upper-crust, along an arc–forearc rheological boundary, to oblique subduction along the Puerto Rico trench. Several faults within the passage, if ruptured completely, are long enough to generate earthquakes with magnitudes on the order of Mw 6.5–7."

The data from this digitisation revealed for the first time the spolvero (a drawing transfer technique) of the portrait. These discoveries change the history of this iconic symbol of Western painting because they are proof that a preparatory drawing was employed. These discoveries were possible because the multispectral camera produces high-resolution images of 13 filters, including 3 IR filters with a high signal-to-noise ratio and optimal spatial resolution. The images are processed with the layer amplification method (L.A.M.), which amplifies weak signals and thus reveals new details. A test board was made to compare the L.A.M. with traditional IR reflectography."

    abstract = "Background MONA) Multicentric Osteolysis, subcutaneous Nodulosis and Athropathy(is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) gene. It is manifested by osteolysis of the carpal and tarsal bones, progressive joint contractures, and fibrocollagenous nodules (1,2). In addition, there are reports of gingival hypertrophy, pigmented skin lesions, coarse face, corneal opacities, and cardiac defects (1,3). Because of joint contractures and dysmorphic features and radiological findings, it can be misdiagnosed as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and mucopolysaccharidoses respectively(4). Most affected children are apparently normal at birth with symptoms' onset usually between six months and six years of age (5); the range is from birth to 11 years (2).To date, 51 individuals have been identified with biallelic pathogenic variants in MMP2 (3,6).Here we report a case of child MONA and galactosemia which is not known before. Objectives To share this interesting extremely rare presentation and new association Methods An eight year old Iraqi boy with Galactosemia at the 4th month of life presented with 4 years history of fractures of his long and short bones after trivial traumas with progressive painful deformities in hands and feet with limitation motion He has seizures, and Atrial septal defects. Intellect is normal, He had coarse facial features, hypertelorism, gum hypertrophy with high arched palate and hirsutism. Painful subcutaneous nodules involving both palms and soles (Figure 1). Figure 1 Results The immunological, hematological and ultrasound were normal. The X-rays showed osteopenia, decrease in joint space and resorption of phalanges with cortical thinning and expansion of the phalangeal and metacarpal bones was a distinct finding (Figure 1).

Paolo Antonio Foscarini’s Scientiarum et artium omnium ferme anacephalaeosis theoretica, a previously unknown work, is a booklet containing 344 theses that the Carmelite friar and theologian Foscarini (c. 1562–1616) prepared for a disputation in honour of the new head of his order. Foscarini devoted eleven of those theses to hieroglyphs, taking several of them almost verbatim from the Monas. This essay examines each of the eleven theses in turn to explore Foscarini’s use of the Monas and his attempt to integrate Dee’s work with material from other sources, such as Johann Trithemius’s De septem secundeis. It then briefly looks at Foscarini’s interest in hieroglyphs after the Anacephalaeosis."

The NS-trending MONA LISA normal-incidence reflection profile 1 was recorded to 26 s twt. Coincident wide-angle data were acquired on nine ocean bottom hydrophones and several onshore mobile seismographs along and off the profile. The model of compressional seismic velocity shows three different crustal types: (a) a typical three-layered shield-type crust below the Ringkøbing Fyn High to the north: (b) a highly complex transitional crust in the central part; and (c) a two-layered crust of Caledonian origin to the south. Sharp and strong normal-incidence and wide-angle reflections from Moho were recorded south of the Caledonian Deformation Front in contrast to less distinct reflections further north. S-dipping crustal reflections from 4 to 11 s twt over ∼70 km horizontal distance terminate at Moho and coincide with a change in the seismic velocity structure. This indicates northward obduction of Avalonian crust. Non-migrated normal-incidence seismic sections show crossing weak N-dipping and stronger S-dipping reflections to 20 s twt from the uppermost mantle. We propose a tectonic model where the closure of the Tornquist Sea took place along a N-dipping subduction zone which was later overprinted by a late-or post-Caledonian S-dipping shear zone. Sub-Moho velocities are 7.8–7.9 km/s under 34–35-km-thick Baltica crust and 8.1–8.3 km/s under 25–26-km-thick Caledonian crust. The sub-horizontal Moho across the Caledonian collision zone implies late- or post-Caledonian re-equilibration of the seismological Moho. We interpret the low-velocity upper mantle (7.8–8.1 km/s) to the north as former Baltica lower crust in eclogite facies after pressure-induced metamorphism as a result of lithospheric flexure during the Caledonian orogeny. These rocks today appear as upper mantle that was uplifted to their present position during the Middle Devonian collapse of the North German-Polish Caledonides."

Therefore, understanding the region's climate variability and predicting extreme weather has become an important scientific problem. Cave stalagmites are widely recognized as high-quality terrestrial paleoclimate proxies due to their accurate dating and high resolution. In this study, we present a stalagmite-based multi-proxy reconstruction of hurricane and hydrological changes in Central America from the island of Isla de Mona, Puerto Rico, for the mid-Holocene period (4700–6260 a BP). Our data suggest a significant influence of solar activity on rainfall patterns in Central America via changes in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Our study further shows that El Niño may have played a role in influencing hurricane development at a decadal scale, and also found that the relationship of hurricane activities and El Niño intensity on the decadal and centennial scale is variable. The implications of our findings are crucial for informing contemporary climate models and enhancing our preparedness for potential future climate scenarios in the region."

It is caused by a deficiency of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2). In the current study we present a comprehensive clinical, radiological, genetic and in silico analysis of MONA in a consanguineous Pakistani family. Clinical and radiological examinations of the three severely affected siblings demonstrated a progressive MONA syndrome with phenotypic variability. The patients presented unusual facial appearance, thickened skin, severe short stature, short hands and feet. Radiographs revealed extensive bone deformities affecting upper and lower arms, legs, vertebrae and hip. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous missense variant [c.539 A > T p.(Asp180Val)] in the MMP2 gene. In silico findings suggested a mutant MMP2 protein with a decreased stability and an altered pattern of interactions. Our findings add to the existing literature on the skeletal phenotype of MONA syndrome, including the specific clinical and radiological patterns observed. Moreover, the study will aid in genetic counseling and accurate diagnosis of families affected by the same disorder within the Pakistani population."

It plays an important role in intracellular signaling in T cells, monocytic cells, and platelets. Here we investigated the regulatory aspects of Mona expression in human hematopoietic cells. This was carried out by combining nucleotide sequence analyzes and experimental approaches. We confirmed that Mona expression is restricted to T-cell, myeloid and platelet lineages. In the various cells examined, we detected two major Mona transcripts (1.9 and 4 kb), likely resulting from the alternative use of two polyadenylation sites. Consequently, Mona transcripts of the same size have identical 3′ untranslated region (UTR), irrespective of the cell type. In contrast, Mona transcripts contain either 5′ UTR-1A or -1B exons, that were detected in a cell-lineage specific manner. Thus, T cells and several myeloid cell lines express 5′ UTR-1A-containing transcripts, whereas platelets and cell lines exhibiting megakaryocytic potential express 5′ UTR-1B-containing transcripts. Interestingly, 5′ UTR-1A is generated from an exon located approximately 45 kb upstream of exon 1B. This suggested that lineage-restricted transcription of the Mona gene is controlled by specific promoters. Indeed, 2-kb genomic fragments upstream of each 5′-UTR showed lineage-restricted ability to drive expression of luc reporter gene."

This method permits in-depth knowledge about such artworks, allowing us to understand their reactions to climatic variations, and provides objective data on which conservation decisions can be confidently based, since the data are directly obtained from the individual artwork. Since 2004, following the invitation from the Louvre Museum and the C2RMF (National Centre for Research and Restoration of French Museums), the wooden panel on which Leonardo da Vinci painted his Mona Lisa has been studied by an international research team of wood technologists and engineers, including researchers from French and Italian universities and related scientific institutions (Montpellier, Clermont Auvergne, Poitiers, Florence), to understand its mechanical, hygroscopic and shape characteristics and behaviour, to evaluate its present state, and to provide suggestions for optimizing its conservation conditions. Non-invasive methods and equipment were therefore devised and implemented to measure (during the annual opening day of its display case) and automatically monitor (during the time the display case remains closed) both the deformations that the panel undergoes (mainly produced by the inevitable small climatic fluctuations within the case) and the constraining forces acting on the panel itself. The method and the related equipment, improved over the years, are based on miniature load cells and displacement transducers, whose outputs are automatically logged at desired time intervals, typically ranging between 30 min for monitoring during the whole year, and a few seconds for manual measurements, calibrations, and other selected events; the stored data can be downloaded both through a cable connection and wirelessly, by means of a specially developed connection apparatus. The panel is confined in a climate-controlled display case, which typically is opened only for a few hours once a year. Additionally, close restrictions must be respected, including absolute non-invasiveness, non-interference with the enjoyment of the artwork by the public, and compliance with strict procedures for safe and secure conservation. The implementation of this method has provided significant information about the actual behaviour of the panel during the whole year. Comparing several annual force-deformation curves, their good linearity suggests that no unacceptable stress or deformation has taken place in it, showing that the climatic conditions (air temperature and relative humidity) maintained in the display case can be considered favourable to the conservation of the artwork. Moreover, based on the collected data, reliable Finite Element Method (FEM) models are being developed and calibrated, with the aim of describing the mechanical behaviour of the panel and virtually evaluating the risk of damage (including the propagation of an ancient crack) deriving from external conditions or actions to which it would be unthinkable to submit the original historic artwork."

The model shows evidence for the presence of upper-and lower Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks as well as differences in crustal structure between the palaeo-continents Laurentia, Avalonia and Baltica. Our new model, together with previous results from transformations of the gravity and magnetic fields, demonstrates correlation between crustal magnetic domains along the profile and the terrane affinity of the crust. This integrated interpretation indicates that a 150 km wide zone, characterized by low-grade metamorphosis and oblique thrusting of Avalonia crust over Baltica lower crust, is characteristic for the central North Sea area. The magnetic susceptibility and the density across the Coffee Soil Fault range from almost zero and 2715 kg/m3 in Avalonia crust to 0.05 SI and 2775 kg/m3 in Baltica crust. The model of MONA LISA profile 3 indicates that the transition between Avalonia and Baltica is located beneath the Central Graben with a ramp–flat–ramp geometry. Our results indicate that the initial rifting of the Central Graben and the Viking Graben was controlled by the location of the Caledonian collisional suture, located at the Coffee Soil Fault, and that the deep crustal part of Baltica extends further to the west than hitherto believed."

    abstract = "Summary The smile on Mona Lisa’s face remains enigmatous and a topic of much discussion in art circle over the centuries. In this essay the author proposes a new principle of art neuroscience or the science of aesthetics namely ‘dynamism’ which artists often employ to impart an illusion of movement in their art works which are essentially static. This illusion is possibly generated through imaginative thinking which involves frontal cortical activation in the viewer’s brain coupled with activation of the motion area (area V5/MT) of the viewer’s visual cortex. It is suggested that this principle of dynamism is somewhat different from the previously described concept of kinetic art. The author hypothesizes that the great painter Leonardo da Vinci very intelligently painted the angles of the mouth of Mona Lisa’s face to evoke this illusion of movement (smile) to increase the aesthetic value of this great work of art."

While the characteristics of Phanerozoic OPS are generally well-known, those of Neoproterozoic OPS, especially their sedimentary components, remain underexplored. We combined field observations with petrography and geochemistry (major and trace elements, Sr–Nd isotopes) of sedimentary rocks from the Gwna Group (Mona Complex, Wales, UK) representing a well-preserved example of Neoproterozoic OPS. The rocks were subdivided into five groups: (1) red chert/jasper, (2) carbonate/dolostone, (3) black mudstone, (4) red/green mudstone, and (5) turbiditic/volcaniclastic rocks. The carbonate rock and red chert fill interpillow spaces or form less than 2-meter-thick layers above a basaltic base. These rocks formed as chemical precipitates from hydrothermal fluid (εNd = −2.4 to −1.2) or hydrothermally fluxed seawater (εNd = −8.3 to −7.4) related to magmatic activity on the seafloor. Unlike Phanerozoic OPS, the studied OPS does not include a thick bedded chert sequence resulting from the accumulation of plankton remains. The red, green, and black mudstones were deposited on the ocean floor in a pelagic or hemipelagic environment under oxygenated and anoxic conditions. They were predominantly sourced from distal mature continental crust as exemplified by their low εNd values (−11.3 to −3.5). In contrast, the turbiditic and volcaniclastic rocks (εNd = −1.9 to +0.8) that form most of the Gwna Group were sourced from an adjacent volcanic arc and deposited in a trench. We show that the OPS lithological and compositional changes relate to Neoproterozoic plate motion and increasing proximity to a subduction zone. The OPS of the Gwna Group serves as a crucial paleooceanographic and paleogeographic indicator in the Neoproterozoic."

These include time, frequency, spatial and channel attention, which can focus on useful time frames, frequency bands, regions or channels while extracting features. However, these traditional attention methods lack the exploration of complex information and multi-scale long-range speech feature interactions, which can benefit SR/LR tasks. To address these issues, this paper firstly proposes mixed-order attention (MOA) for low frame-level speech features to gain the finest grain multi-order information at higher resolution. We then combine that with a non-local attention (NLA) mechanism and a dilated residual structure to balance fine grained local detail with convolution from multi-scale long-range time/frequency regions in feature space. The proposed dilated mixed-order non-local attention network (D-MONA) exploits the detail available from the first and the second-order feature attention analysis, but achieves this over a much wider context than purely local attention. Experiments are conducted on three datasets, including two SR tasks of Voxceleb and CN-celeb, and one LR task, NIST LRE 07. For SR, D-MONA improves on ResNet-34 results by at least 29\% and 15\% for Voxceleb1 and CN-celeb respectively. For the LR task, a large improvement is achieved over ResNet-34 of 21\% for the challenging 3s utterance condition, 59\% for the 10s condition and 67\% for the 30s condition. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art deep bottleneck feature-DNN (DBF-DNN) x-vector system at all scales."

Only 1.2\% of participants with no cardiovascular risk factors according to the French guidelines had an LDL-cholesterol concentration above the recommended target, whereas 82.5\% of high-risk subjects did not attain their goal (70.8\% among high-risk subjects receiving lipid-lowering therapy).

When risk was classified according to the European guidelines, the majority of participants did not reach the recommended LDL-cholesterol targets, irrespective of their level of risk or lipid-lowering therapy. Conclusion In a majority of primary prevention candidates with multiple risk factors and in most high-risk subjects, LDL-cholesterol targets recommended by French guidelines are not being achieved, either because of insufficient treatment or because subjects are not recognized as being at risk. More stringent targets proposed by the European guidelines are not being achieved in most cases. Résumé Contexte Le contrôle du cholestérol-LDL est primordial pour réduire le risque cardiovasculaire. Objectifs Décrire l’atteinte des objectifs fixés par les recommandations françaises et européennes pour le cholestérol-LDL, en fonction du niveau de risque cardiovasculaire. Méthodes Les participants, âgés de 35 à 74ans (n=4609) ont été tirés au sort dans la population générale de trois régions françaises. Un recueil de données standardisé a été effectué pour déterminer le niveau de risque cardiovasculaire, tel que décrit dans les recommandations françaises et européennes. Résultats L’échantillon comprenait 17,5 \% de participants à haut risque (recommandations françaises) et 25,4 \% de sujets à haut ou très haut risque (recommandations européennes). Seulement 1,2 \% des participants sans facteur de risque (recommandations françaises) avaient un taux de cholestérol-LDL au-dessus de l’objectif. En revanche, 82,5 \% des sujets à haut risque n’étaient pas à l’objectif (70,8 \% des sujets à haut risque sous traitement hypolipémiant). Parmi les sujets non traités, la réduction médiane de cholestérol-LDL nécessaire pour atteindre l’objectif, variait de 6,6 \% (sujets les moins à risque) à 36,0 \% (haut risque). Lorsque le risque était défini selon les critères européens, la majorité des participants n’atteignait pas l’objectif, qu’il y ait ou non prise d’un traitement hypolipémiant. Conclusion La majorité des sujets à haut risque ou cumulant les facteurs de risque n’est pas à l’objectif, soit du fait d’un traitement insuffisant, soit parce que les sujets ne sont pas identifiés comme étant à risque. Cela est encore plus marqué si l’on considère les objectifs des recommandations européennes."

    abstract = "This paper understands inhalant use – the deliberate inhalation of volatile solvents or glues with intentions of intoxication – as a socially and culturally constituted practice. It describes the inhalant use of young street people in Mexico City from their perspective (“the vicioso or inhalant fiend's point of view”). Background Even if inhalant use is globally associated with economic inequality and deprivation, there is a marked lack of ethnography. Incomprehension and indignation have blocked our understanding of inhalant use as a form of marginalised drug use. The current explanation models reduce inhalant consumption to universal factors and individual motives; separating the practice from its context, these models tend to overlook gustatory meanings and experiences. Methods The paper is informed by long-term, on-going fieldwork with young street people in Mexico City. Fieldwork was done from 1990 through 2010, in regular periods of fieldwork and shorter visits, often with Mexican colleagues. We created extensive sets of fieldnotes, which were read and re-read. Results “Normalcy” is a striking feature of inhalant use in Mexico City. Street-wise inhabitants of popular neighbourhoods have knowledge about inhalants and inhalant users, and act accordingly. Subsequently, Mexico City's elaborate street culture of sniffing is discussed, that is, the range of inhalants used, how users classify the substances, and their techniques for sniffing. The paper also distinguishes three patterns of inhalant use, which more or less correlate with age. These patterns indicate embodiments of street culture: the formation within users of gusto, that is, an acquired appetite for inhalants, and of vicio, the inhalant fiends’ devotion to inhalants. Conclusion What emerges from the ethnographic findings is an elaborate street culture of sniffing, a complex configuration of shared perspectives and embodied practices, which are shaped by and shaping social exclusion. These findings are relevant to appreciate and address the inhalant fiends’ acquired appetite and habit."

    abstract = "Background “Multicentric Osteolysis with Nodulosis and Arthropathy” (MONA) also known as Winchester-Torg syndrome is a rare chronic skeleton disorder caused by matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) deficiency. It is characterised by facial dysmorphism, subcutaneous fibrocollagenous nodules, carpal and tarsal osteolysis and interphalangeal joint erosions. Short stature and Osteopenia are frequent and heart defects have been described. As children first present with joint pain, swelling and stiffness, MONA is often misdiagnosed as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Objectives We report the first Lebanese family with 3 siblings presenting MONA, two of which were diagnosed at first as JIA. Methods The proband is the eldest boy born of consanguineous parents. At birth, a ventricular septal defect (VSD) was noted. At the age of 5 bone erosions and nodules in his hands and feet, and cuneiform vertebrae of unknown cause appeared. He was diagnosed with JIA. His pain partially improved with methotrexate and TNF agonist treatment; steroid injections were performed in wrists and permitted a gain in range of motion. Secondarily, Osteopenia was detected. The middle boy was examined at the age of 7; he had wrist arthritis and metacarpal tenosynovitis. He was known to have psoriasis. He was treated first with steroid injections then with NSAID and methotrexate with a good response but his condition slowly progressed to deviated fingers. The youngest boy suffered from foot pain and Kohler disease was diagnosed at the age of 4. Soon after he developed global stiffness of the foot with erosions and nodules. He had failure to thrive and a VSD was detected. Results This family history along with the progressive coarsening of face features in the 3 siblings raised the possibility of a genetic disorder. Exome sequencing for skeletal dysplasia in the eldest boy detected a mutation in the MMP2 gene (NM\_001127891:exon2:c.8A>G:p.Y3C). The same mutation was found in the 2 other siblings. Conclusions These cases are to add to the 44 individuals coming from 27 different families, with molecularly proven MONA reported in the medical literature. This diagnosis should be raised in front of patients having resistant articular erosions with hand and feet nodules, despite anti-rheumatic drugs. Till date, no specific therapy is available and management is only supportive. In this described family, steroid injections were efficient when children presented with swelling and stiffness of joints and seemed to slow progression to erosion.

Using image-based 3D modelling, the main geomatics techniques is photogrammetry, it allows for new methods to create virtual 3D. To do this, various components including route visualizations must collaborate. To do this work we have a framework that leverages the technology and data sources already available to reduce the time and work required for prospective 3D applications. With the existence of a Monas 3D visualization that can be accessed through web browser, it expected that it will make tourists not complicated to obtain various tourism information and increase the tourism in Jakarta."

It comprises an ophiolite, high-pressure metamorphic rocks, volcaniclastic sediments and mélanges. However, understanding of the tectonic evolution has been held back by the paucity of age constraints, thus only a major geochronological study will be sufficient to decipher the subduction, accretion and exhumation history of this significant Avalonian orogen. We conducted U-Pb dating of detrital zircons in the Monian Supergroup in order to constrain the maximum depositional ages, and undertook K-Ar dating of phengites and U-Pb dating of detrital zircons in the Blueschist unit, the Central Shear Zone (CSZ), and the New Harbour Group to estimate the timing and duration of the metamorphic events, and to constrain the minimum depositional ages of the Gwna Group. Our geochronological data give minimum (K-Ar) depositional ages of 578–530Ma on phengites and maximum (U-Pb zircon) depositional ages of 878–550Ma, which indicates that the sediments in the structurally uppermost Gwna Group were deposited earlier than those in the middle New Harbour Group (maximum depositional ages of 548–515Ma, this study) and earlier than in the lowermost South Stack Group (maximum depositional ages of 569–522Ma, this study). Phengite-rich schists in the Blueschist unit and the CSZ show indistinct K-Ar ages ranging from ca. 578 to 530Ma. However, the K-Ar age of the New Harbour Group is ca. 474Ma, which we interpret to reflect a later metamorphic event. In a larger perspective, our new ages are broadly contemporaneous with the calc-alkaline continental arc magmatism in NW Wales and Central England that formed by successive eastward subduction from ca.711 to 474Ma."

This impedes esthetic appreciation as well as scholarly inspection of the piece. Unfortunately, the physical condition of the painting is such that it will not undergo cleaning and treatment very soon. Consequently, digital computer image processing has been applied to the artwork to recover an approximation of its original appearance and to bring out long-hidden details. This was accomplished first by digitizing a high-quality photograph of the composition to 6-million-pixel resolution and then applying gain-bias modulation to the RGB image files to recover the original varnish-free colors. The image restoration was completed through removal of the craquelure by numerically intensive IBM 3090 processing of the data in the large files of RGB data. Sequential application of matched-FFT and blue/green bi-scatter filters yielded the final result. Regional enhancement, local enhancement, and pseudo-color coding of the restored image uncovered pentimenti as well as areas where the painting has been modified. These indicate that at some point in the creation of the piece, a necklace and additional mountains were present. Such clarifications bring out a dramatic tension in the background, revealing a metaphor of the human condition."

The structure of the MoNa layer was composed of fibers with considerably small grain size (\textasciitilde 5nm).

Two definitions were assessed, one taking into account a treatment for hypertension and for elevated triglycerides or reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Met2) and the other not (Met). Methods Two cross-sectional representative surveys of the general population were carried out in 1996 and 2006 in three French areas: the Urban Community of Lille in the North, the districts of Bas-Rhin in the East and of Haute-Garonne in the South. Inhabitants aged 35-64 years were randomly recruited from electoral rolls after stratification on gender, 10 year-age group and town size. Standardized sociodemographic, medical and anthropometric data were collected and a fasted blood sample was analysed centrally. Prevalences in the age group 35-64 years were adjusted for the French population of year 2000. Results A total of 3405 subjects in 1996 and 3554 subjects in 2006 were included in the analyses. In both years the metabolic syndrome was more common among men than among women and increased with age. The age-adjusted prevalences [95\% confidence interval] of Met were 26.3\% [23.9-28.7] and 18.1\% [16.1-20.1] in 1996 and 23.1\% [20.9-25.3] and 15.1\% [13.3-16.9] in 2006, in men and women respectively. The equivalent results for Met2 were 30.5\%, 21.5\%, 24.8\% and 16.4\%. The age-adjusted prevalence of Met (Met2) decreased significantly by 12.1\% (18.7\%) in men and 16.6\% (23.7\%) in women. Of the five Met criteria, decreasing trends were observed in the prevalence of high blood pressure, elevated fasting glucose, low HDL cholesterol. By contrast, prevalence of abdominal obesity appeared unchanged whereas prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia increased significantly. Conclusions In France, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome tended to decline in the last decade in both genders, particularly in women."

    abstract = "Introduction Le spectre ostéolyse multicentrique-nodulose-arthropathie (MONA syndrome) est un trouble squelettique progressif héréditaire rare, touchant les enfants entre 1 et 5 ans, causé par des mutations du gène de la protéine métalloprotéinase matricielle 2 (MMP2). Il se caractérise par des ostéolyses périphériques multiples touchant les articulations interphalangiennes et phalangiennes du carpe, du tarse, avec de larges os métacarpiens et métatarsiens. Une contracture articulaire progressive s’installe limitant l’amplitude des mouvements. Les patients présentent une dysmorphie faciale (front proéminent et hypertélorisme), une hypertrophie des gencives, des opacités cornéennes, une hyperpigmentation, une hypertrichose et des nodules sous-cutanés. Ils ont une petite taille et souffre d’ostéoporose responsable de fractures. Des malformations cardiaques associées ont été rapportées. Le diagnostic repose sur les caractéristiques cliniques typiques et un bilan biologique normal permettant de distinguer cette maladie des autres syndromes, notamment les maladies fibrotiques, rhumatismales et lysosomales. Les options de traitement sont limitées. Observation Nous présentons le cas de deux sœurs ayant le syndrome MONA : A.N., dix ans et A.I., sept ans, aux antécédents de fractures des os longs après un léger traumatisme, qui présentent des déformations douloureuses progressives des mains et des pieds avec limitation des mouvements, des traits de visage grossiers et une hypertrichose mais aucun nodule sous-cutané. Il n’existe aucun traitement spécifique pour les maladies du spectre MONA, la prise en charge est essentiellement symptomatique. Cependant, nous avons essayé un traitement par bisphosphonates (zolédronate intraveineux tous les 6 mois) et nous avons évalué les paramètres suivants : douleurs osseuses (EVA), amplitude de mouvement, croissance staturopondérale, fonction neurocognitive, apparition d’autres fractures ou de complications liées à la maladie ou au traitement. Résultats Les douleurs osseuses ont été réduites peu après le début du traitement. L’amplitude des mouvements ne s’est pas améliorée de manière significative. Le développement neurocognitif était normal. Aucune autre fracture à faible impact n’est survenue après le début du traitement par bisphosphonates. Bien que la maladie soit évolutive, elles sont toujours capables de marcher et d’utiliser leurs mains pour écrire. L’amélioration des symptômes a été plus marquée chez la plus jeune des sœurs. Discussion La thérapie par bisphosphonates s’est avérée particulièrement efficace pour contrôler les douleurs osseuses et réduire les fractures dans les troubles du spectre MONA. L’instauration précoce du traitement semble particulièrement importante afin d’obtenir le meilleur résultat possible. Conclusion Le traitement par bisphosphonates IV semble une alternative prometteuse au cours du spectre MONA."

    abstract = "Background Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are often used to evaluate individuals' food intakes in epidemiologic studies because of their simplicity and low cost. Objective To assess the validity of a short (24 items), qualitative FFQ used in the MONA LISA-NUT study. Design Cross-sectional study of a representative sample in three French counties. Participants/setting The sample included 2,630 participants aged 35 to 65 years from the MONA LISA-NUT study. Main outcome measures Food consumption was measured with the FFQ and via food records for 3 consecutive days. Plasma fatty acids were measured from a subset of participants. Statistical analyses performed The FFQ items' validity was assessed by calculating crude and deattenuated Pearson correlation coefficients between frequencies reported by the FFQ and average weights reported by the food records. Furthermore, the validity of some items of the FFQ measuring the consumption of fatty foods was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between frequencies of consumption of these foods and dosages of the corresponding plasma fatty acids: fish and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), olive oil and oleic acid, margarine and elaidic acid, and dairy products and pentadecanoic and heptadecanoic acids. Results The mean of the deattenuated Pearson correlation coefficients for all items was 0.46, with values ranging from 0.22 (fried food) to 0.77 (breakfast cereal). The correlation coefficient was ≤0.4 for one third of the 24 items. Moderate correlations were found between fish and EPA/DHA (EPA: r=0.43, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.51; DHA: r=0.39, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.47), but not for other food items. Conclusions One third of the 24 items in the short, qualitative FFQ evaluated here were not sufficiently valid. However, for the food groups most commonly studied in the literature, this FFQ had the same degree of validity as other questionnaires designed to classify subjects according to their level of intake."

Morphological features of the taxon were similar to those described elsewhere. The species was observed only in late summer; elevated bottom water temperature, and perhaps phosphorus concentration, appears to be implicated in its appearance. Maximum abundances at any given site reached 393 and 0.9 trichomes/mL in Mona Lake and Muskegon Lake, respectively. Although these concentrations are low relative to other reports, the presence of this species in these two lakes from adjacent watersheds adds to a growing body of literature that suggests the distribution of C. raciborskii is on the increase in northern latitudes."

For example, this method has been used to show that detecting an up- or down-turned mouth is a primary strategy for discriminating happy versus sad expressions. We explored the detection of surprise using CIs, expecting widened eyes, raised eyebrows, and open mouths to be dominant features. We briefly presented a photograph of a female face with a neutral expression embedded in random visual noise, which modulated the appearance of the face on a trial-by-trial basis. In separate sessions, we showed this face with or without eyebrows to test the importance of the raised eyebrow element of surprise. Noise samples were aggregated into CIs based on participant responses. Results show that the eye-region was most informative for detecting surprise. Unless attention was specifically directed to the mouth, we found no effects in the mouth region. The eye effect was stronger when the eyebrows were absent, but the eyebrow region was not itself informative and people did not infer eyebrows when they were missing. A follow-up study was conducted in which participants rated the emotional valence of the neutral images combined with their associated CIs. This verified that CIs for ‘surprise’ convey surprised expressions, while also showing that CIs for ‘not surprise’ convey disgust. We conclude that the eye-region is important for the detection of surprise."

    abstract = "Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is implicated in signaling downstream of the T cell receptor. Its non-catalytic, C-terminal half contains several prolinerich motifs, which have been shown to interact with different SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins in vitro. One of these, Mona/Gads, was also shown to bind HPK1 in mouse T cells in vivo. The region of HPK1 that binds to the Mona/Gads C-terminal SH3 domain has been mapped and shows only very limited similarity to a recently identified high affinity binding motif in SLP-76, another T-cell adaptor. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography, the binding of the HPK1 motif to Mona/Gads SH3C has now been characterized in molecular detail. The results indicate that although charge interactions through an RXXK motif are essential for complex formation, a PXXP motif in HPK1 strongly complements binding. This unexpected binding mode therefore differs considerably from the previously described interaction of Mona/Gads SH3C with SLP-76. The crystal structure of the complex highlights the great versatility of SH3 domains, which allows interactions with very different proteins. This currently limits our ability to categorize SH3 binding properties by simple rules."

We found that M-CSF induced late and massive phosphorylation of ERK molecules in Mona-expressing myeloid cells compared to non-expressing cells.

It characterized by multiple peripheral osteolysis, wide metacarpals, osteoporosis, progressive joint contractures, short stature, subcutaneous nodules as well as a coarse face, skin lesions/hirsutism and ocular and cardiac manifestations. The diagnosis is based on the typical clinical features together with normal laboratory findings, which allow this disease to be distinguished from other syndromes, including fibrotic, rheumatic and lysosomal diseases. Treatment options are limited. Objectives Bisphosphonates in (MONA) spectrum disorder may be an alternative therapeutic approach. Methods We present successful bisphosphonate therapy in two affected sisters, A.N, ten-year-old and A.I, seven-year-old, presented with history of fractures of their long bones after trivial traumas with progressive painful deformities in hands and feet with limitation motion. They were treated with bisphosphonates (intravenous zoledronate every 6 months). The following outcome variables were assessed: skeletal pain, range of motion, internal medical problems as well as neurocognitive function. Results Skeletal pain was reduced soon after initiation of therapy. Range of motion did not significantly improve. Neurocognitive development was normal. No further low-impact fractures occurred after starting bisphosphonate therapy. Although the nature of the disease is progressive, they are still able to walk and use their hands for writing. Conclusion Bisphosphonate therapy was effective especially in controlling skeletal pain and reducing fractures in MONA spectrum disorder. Early initiation of treatment seems to be particularly important in order to achieve the best possible outcome. Reference [1] Pichler, K. et al.

Previous investigations disclosed two Mona Lisas Leonardo painted on the same panel [1, 2], but the actual steps Leonardo used to metamorphosize the first model, Isabella, Duchess of Aragon, into the celebrated Mona Lisa have remained unclear until now. Current studies reveal the specific features of the first model Leonardo changes, or combined with his own features to realize the universally known Mona Lisa."

Marine litter (34.12 kg) was caught by artisanal fishermen in MONA Cagarras proximities, and plastics represented ∼79 \%. Personal hygiene items and strains of hair were found, suggesting sewage-derived contamination from Ipanema SSO. Microplastics were detected in MONA Cagarras surface waters. Fragments and black particle were the most frequently found microplastic shape and color, respectively. μ-FTIR analysis identified, in descending order of occurrence, polystyrene-PS, polyethylene-PE, polyvinyl chloride-PVC, polypropylene-P, and polyamide-PA. Our integrated results of macro and microplastic contamination highlight an issue of effective conservation and health of marine biodiversity in MONA Cagarras and surrounding waters and a concern for better management of Brazilian MPAs."

The present study compared the transcriptome changes of heat-tolerant wild (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum L.) genotype and heat-sensitive cultivated Hordeum (‘Mona’ cultivar) barley subjected to control (24 ± 2 °C) and heat stress (40 ± 2 °C, 3 h) conditions via RNA sequencing with the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. The wild barley genotype exhibited less impact from heat stress on growth and physiology than the ‘Mona’ cultivar. Heat stress led to 2141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the heat-tolerant wild genotype and 1456 in the ‘Mona’ cultivar. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed that biological processes such as defense response to heat stress, proline and polyamine biosynthesis, and oxidative stress scavenging were predominantly involved in the thermo-tolerance of wild barley. Moreover, heat shock proteins, osmoprotectants, and catalytic activity were identified as the most critical molecular functions in response to high temperatures in wild barley. The significant alterations in the expression levels of candidate genes in response to heat stress highlight these genes' pivotal role in the thermo-tolerance of wild barley compared to the heat-sensitive 'Mona' cultivar. Comparing the evolved mechanisms in response to high temperatures between wild and cultivated barley helps identify the effective heat tolerance mechanisms in the thermo-tolerant wild genotype."

Limited gene flow among isolated demes can result in increased genetic divergence among populations, and decreased genetic diversity within demes. We assessed patterns of genetic variation in the Caribbean boa Chilabothrus monensis (Epicrates monensis) using two mitochondrial and seven nuclear markers, and relying on the largest number of specimens of these snakes examined to date. Two disjunct subspecies of C. monensis are recognized: the threatened C. m. monensis, endemic to Mona Island, and the rare and endangered C. m. granti, which occurs on various islands of the Puerto Rican Bank. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers revealed unambiguous genetic differences between the taxa, and coalescent species delimitation methods indicated that these snakes likely are different evolutionary lineages, which we recognize at the species level, C. monensis and C. granti. All examined loci in C. monensis (sensu stricto) are monomorphic, which may indicate a recent bottleneck event. Each population of C. granti exclusively contains private mtDNA haplotypes, but five of the seven nuclear genes assayed are monomorphic, and nucleotide diversity is low in the two remaining markers. The faster pace of evolution of mtDNA possibly reflects the present-day isolation of populations of C. granti, whereas the slower substitution rate of nuDNA may instead mirror the relatively recent episodes of connectivity among the populations facilitated by the lower sea level during the Pleistocene. The small degree of overall genetic variation in C. granti suggests that demes of this snake could be managed as a single unit, a practice that would significantly increase their effective population size."

Its diagnosis can be deceptively similar to childhood-onset genetic skeletal dysplasias and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We aimed to report the syndrome’s clinical and radiologic features with emphasis on skeletal manifestations. And establish relevant phenotype-genotype correlations. We evaluated two boys, 4-and-7-years-old with MONA syndrome. Both patients had consanguineous parents. We verified the diagnosis by correlating the outcomes of clinical, radiologic and molecular analysis. We specifically evaluated the craniofacial morphology and clinical and radiographic skeletal abnormalities. We contextualized the resultant phenotype-genotype correlations to publications on MONA and its differential diagnosis. Skeletal manifestations were the presenting symptoms and mostly restricted to hands and feet in terms of fixed extension deformity of the metacarpophalangeal and flexion deformity of the interphalangeal joints with extension deformity of big toes. There were arthritic symptoms in the older patient especially of the wrists and minute pathologic fractures. The skeletal radiographs showed osteopenia/dysplastic changes of hands and feet. Both patients had variants in the matrix metalloproteinase2 gene which conformed to phenotype of previously reported literature in one patient while the other had a novel variant which conformed to MONA phenotype. Craniofacial abnormalities were present. However, minimal extra-skeletal manifestations. Overall, there is an emerging distinctive skeletal pattern of involvement in terms of both clinical and radiographic features. This includes age of onset and location of presenting skeletal manifestations, chronological order of joint affection, longitudinal disease progression, specifics of skeletal radiographic pathology and craniofacial features. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned against differential diagnosis of similar genetic skeletal dysplasias and juvenile idiopathic arthritis."

Animal models with hypothalamic, genetic or dietary obesity have been examined with a feedback model. Four common final pathways are involved in this model. One of these final common pathways is the sympathetic nervous system. Most Obesities k/Nown Are Low In Sympathetic Activity states the MONA LISA Hypothesis. A second common pathway is the endocrine system involving adrenal glucocorticosteroids. The third common pathway is hyperphagia. Although not essential for most obesities, hyperphagia may be essential in animals with injury to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. The final pathway is reduced physical activity. The tonic activity of these systems and their response to changes in the diet affect nutrient partitioning between fat and protein. This framework has been used to review genetic obesity, hypothalamic obesity and dietary obesity."

    abstract = "Objective Stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) may be required to achieve an adequate landing zone in up to 40\% of descending thoracic aneurysms (DTAs). The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) consists of a main stent graft and a branch stent graft designed to maintain LSA patency while diverting circulation through the encroaching aneurysm. Participating in the United States Food and Drug Administration's new Innovation Pathway, this first-in-human, early feasibility study evaluates early clinical experience of the Valiant Mona LSA Stent Graft System in patients with DTAs where the proximal landing zone necessitates LSA coverage. Methods This premarket, nonrandomized, single-arm prospective study recruited nine patients (age 72.9 ± 7.6 years). Primary end points were aneurysm-related mortality, stroke, paraplegia, left arm/hand ischemia, and treatment success. Neurologic events were assessed by imaging and by independent neurologists. Inclusion criteria required patients with a DTA or penetrating aortic ulcer to have a distance of ≥10 mm between the left common carotid artery and the LSA. Mean aneurysm diameter was 53.7 ± 10.0 mm. The indication for repair was for saccular DTA in five patients or fusiform DTA in four. Seven patients were at American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification III/IV. Results All nine patients received one main stent graft (diameter 28 to 42 mm) and one branch stent graft (diameter 10 to 14 mm). To extend device coverage distally, a commercial Valiant Captivia device was implanted in seven patients. No uncorrected endoleaks were observed at the end of the implant procedure. Four endoleaks developed before discharge in four of eight evaluable patients. Two were identified as type II and two were of undetermined type. No endoleak resulted in a secondary intervention. Technical success, defined by the clinical investigational plan, was achieved in all nine patients intraoperatively, and treatment success was achieved in all eight evaluable patients at 1 month. There were no major, disabling strokes. Four minor nondisabling strokes were reported in three patients ≤30 days (days 1, 1, 5, and 24). To date, there have been no reports of death, left arm ischemia, paraplegia, rupture, conversion to open surgery, or secondary endovascular procedure. No patients required surgical LSA revascularization. Conclusions The Valiant Mona LSA system demonstrates technical and treatment success, relative safety, and early durability in its initial use in DTA patients. Midterm results are expected as patients are monitored at regular intervals to 5 years."

The suture zone is imaged by S-dipping crustal reflections from 1.9 to 10.6s two-way travel time (twt) over a horizontal distance of ∼70km within the transitional crust. The reflection suture zone terminates in a ∼60km wide reflective lens with velocities of 6.6–6.8km/s in the lowermost crust. The reflective lens may be interpreted as a remnant of oceanic or island-arc crust that was accreted to the leading edge of Baltica during closure of the Tornquist Sea. Alternatively, the reflective lens may represent an indentor of Baltica crust into the Avalonian terrane. The change in lower crustal reflectivity and the abrupt transition from a three- to a two-layered crust further south suggest that the Trans-European Fault and the Elbe Lineament continue into the North Sea. The upper mantle reflectivity is dominated by bands of strong-amplitude, S-dipping reflections from 13.5 to 21.8s twt, and a weaker band of N-dipping reflections from 12 to 16s twt. Reversed wide-angle refractions and reflections indicate the presence of a S-dipping high-velocity layer (8.65–8.8km/s) in the uppermost mantle. The sub-Moho high-velocity layer partially coincides with the strong S-dipping normal-incidence mantle reflections. We propose that the S-dipping mantle structure may represent a late-Caledonian or Late Carboniferous to Early Permian mantle shear zone."

This genre-based study looks at how the artist constructs a feminist glocal identity through a combination of song lyrics, musical style, cultural iconography, body decoration, gesture and film techniques that localize the oppositional super-vernacular of Chicano rap while challenging discourses of patriarchy and nationalism. The study also takes into account data from an interview with the artist and social media to gain insights into issues of authenticity and cultural appropriation."

The multiplier accelerator mechanism dominates the short-term reaction, although moderated by capacity effects on export prices. In the long run, however, the response of wages and interest rates will change the nature of the model from mainly fix price Keynesian to more classical, where real production changes less than prices. The price sensitivity of foreign trade plays a crucial role in this process of crowding out, and the nominal rather than the real rate of interest is the vehicle for monetary transmission to the real sector."

In order to acquire data about the mechanical behaviour of the panel, and to feed and calibrate appropriate simulation models, the team has not only set up a continuous monitoring by means of automatic equipment, but has also performed manual measurements on the occasion of the annual openings of the showcase where the masterpiece is conserved and exhibited. This paper reports about techniques used for estimating the forces acting between the wooden panel and its frame (the châssis-cadre), and their location, such data being of primary importance for evaluating the panel's internal stresses. The contact forces have been calculated on the basis of the local contact pressures, imprinted on a pressure-sensitive foil as a range of saturation values of the colour developed in the contact areas. The forces calculated as above have also been compared with the contact forces between the panel's back face and the crossbeams pressing it against the châssis-cadre, which have been measured by means of a load cell. As could be expected, the results from so different techniques do not strictly coincide; however the agreement is fairly good."

The area affected by this tsunami is now significantly more populated. Newly acquired high-resolution bathymetry and seismic reflection lines in the Mona Passage show a fresh submarine landslide 15 km northwest of Rinćon in northwestern Puerto Rico and in the vicinity of the first published earthquake epicenter. The landslide area is approximately 76 km2 and probably displaced a total volume of 10 km3. The landslide's headscarp is at a water depth of 1200 m, with the debris flow extending to a water depth of 4200 m. Submarine telegraph cables were reported cut by a landslide in this area following the earthquake, further suggesting that the landslide was the result of the October 11, 1918 earthquake. On the other hand, the location of the previously suggested source of the 1918 tsunami, a normal fault along the east wall of Mona Rift, does not show recent seafloor rupture. Using the extended, weakly non-linear hydrodynamic equations implemented in the program COULWAVE, we modeled the tsunami as generated by a landslide with a duration of 325 s (corresponding to an average speed of \textasciitilde 27 m/s) and with the observed dimensions and location. Calculated marigrams show a leading depression wave followed by a maximum positive amplitude in agreement with the reported polarity, relative amplitudes, and arrival times. Our results suggest this newly-identified landslide, which was likely triggered by the 1918 earthquake, was the primary cause of the October 11, 1918 tsunami and not the earthquake itself. Results from this study should be useful to help discern poorly constrained tsunami sources in other case studies."

The mazes are networks of distinctly marked rooms randomly interconnected by doors that open probabilistically. The mazes are used to examine two important problems related to artificial neural networks: (1) the retention of long-term state information and (2) the modular use of learned information. For the former, mazes impose a context learning demand: at the beginning of the maze, an initial door choice forms a context that must be remembered until the end of the maze, where the same numbered door must be chosen again in order to reach the goal. For the latter, the effect of modular and non-modular training is examined. In modular training, the door associations are trained in separate trials from the intervening maze paths, and only presented together in testing trials. All networks performed well on mazes without the context learning requirement. The Mona and LSTM networks performed well on context learning with non-modular training; the Elman performance degraded as the task length increased. Mona also performed well for modular training; both the LSTM and Elman networks performed poorly with modular training."

To quantify the effect, we asked naı̈ve observers to rank the face of Mona Lisa superimposed with noise, based on their perception of her emotional state along the sad/happy dimension. Typically, a hundred trials (with 10 or more samples for each rank category) were sufficient to reveal areas altering the facial expression, which is about two orders of magnitude less than in the other reverse correlation studies. Moreover, the perception of smiling in the eyes was solely attributable to a configurational effect projecting from the mouth region."

Thus, platelets and megakaryocytic cell lines K562 and HEL (Human Erythro-Leukemia) specifically express 1B messenger RNA (mRNA). We report here characterization of the (−2031/+72) genomic region relative to the putative transcription start site of 1B mRNA. We show this region is sufficient to ensure specific reporter gene expression in megakaryocytic cell lines, and that most promoter activity is contained in the (−225/+72) fragment. Electro-mobility shift assay and mutational analyses indicated that GATA-1 and a yet unidentified E-26 family member transcription factor are required for 1B (−2031/+72) promoter activity. Thus, Mona 1B promoter exhibits typical features of megakaryocyte-specific promoters."

The driving forces for these developments were end-users' economical and operational considerations as well as future turbocharging requirements of new engine applications, e.g. emission limits. Rig testing is not only mandatory in the design and development phase of new turbocharger turbines, but also plays an important role in helping turbomachinery designers continue to improve their design tools and methods with accurate validation data. The data provided by rig testing-both overall performance data and internal data-is required to develop and enhance the design tools that are used, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The turbocharger turbine test rig called MONA VI is described in the present paper. The article gives an overview of the rig installation and its integration into the infrastructure at ABB Turbo Systems Ltd. The configuration of the test rig to meet the requirements during the development process of a turbocharger turbine, considering not only time and cost but also flexibility, is highlighted."

Monian stratigraphy has been repeatedly revised yet important problems remain in determining relative and absolute ages of rocks within the Complex. Some Monian rocks long believed to be Precambrian have recently yielded Cambrian palynomorphs (Gwna Group) and radiometric dates as young as 518 ± 17 Ma (Sarn granite). Given the uncertainty which exists over the age of the earliest Cambrian sedimentation in the Welsh Basin (somewhere between 590–510 Ma), there need be no conflict between Monian age data and the field evidence which indicates the Mona Complex to be older than the Welsh Basin. The occurrence in Anglesey of blueschist, melange and ‘ophiolites’ (?), with nearby ignimbrites, has resulted in Monian geology being explained in terms of palaeo-subduction. The evidence for this is weak. No-one has yet proved the existence of a Monian accretionary prism, or forearc basin, or volcanic are. All previous models invoking Monian subduction are rejected as oversimplistic. Like the Ganderian of Newfoundland, Monian rocks once lay on the NW margin of the Avalonian plate. Most previous subduction models assume this location to be synonymous with the SE margin of the Iapetus Ocean. Yet the Monian Supergroup, with its enigmatic provenance, may have been deposited before Iapetus opened. The source area could even have been the ‘vanished continent’ possibly removed by transcurrent faulting from a position S of the Dalradian Basin. The potential importance of early transcurrent movement to Monian evolution has been overlooked. Internally, much of the complex appears as a tectonic collage with steeply dipping mylonitic ‘Penmynydd’ schist zones of probably early Cambrian age separating strips of deformed low grade melange from continental crustal basement. The Complex has little in common with adjacent areas and may represent part of an exotic terrain moved to approximately its present position during the Cambrian."

It is more reasonable to formulate NAS as a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition to prediction performance, multi-objective NAS (MONAS) problems take into account other criteria like the number of parameters and inference latency. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are the preferred approach for tackling MONAS due to their effectiveness in dealing with multi-objective optimization problems. Recently, local search-based NAS algorithms have demonstrated their efficiency over MOEAs for MONAS problems. However, their performance has been only verified on bi-objective NAS problems. In this article, we propose a local search algorithm for multi-objective NAS (LOMONAS), an efficient local search framework for solving not only bi-objective NAS problems but also NAS problems having more than two objectives. We additionally present a parameter-less version of LOMONAS, namely IMS-LOMONAS, by combining LOMONAS with the Interleaved Multi-start Scheme (IMS) to help NAS practitioners avoid manual control parameter settings. Experimental results from a series of benchmark problems in the CEC’23 Competition demonstrate the competitiveness of LOMONAS and IMS-LOMONAS compared to MOEAs in tackling MONAS within both small-scale and large-scale search spaces.

The seismic data clearly image structures in the crust and uppermost mantle that may be related to Caledonian collision and Late Palaeozoic to Mesozoic rifting and basin formation. For the first time, dipping and subhorizontal reflections from the mantle have been observed to 24 s twt in seismic normal-incidence reflection sections. Strong sub-horizontal reflections are observed on two perpendicular profiles at c. 21 s twt, which is near the base of the lithosphere. These deep reflections are sharper than expected from a thermal–rheological transition suggesting that they are generated at lithological or tectonic interfaces. The Moho is reflective along all four profiles. Particularly strong and sharp normal-incidence and wide-angle reflections were recorded from the Moho south of the Caledonian Deformation Front. The normal-incidence reflection sections show unusually low intra-crustal reflectivity. Lower crustal, subhorizontal reflectivity is only observed west of the Central Graben and in a short profile segment at the base of the interpreted Caledonian Deformation Front. The crustal suture between Avalonia and Baltica is interpreted to be south- to west-dipping. SSW- and N-dipping reflections to 20 s twt are observed from the uppermost mantle. Two models of Tornquist Sea subduction may explain these events: either southward subduction and later extensional reactivation or northward subduction with later extension along a SSW-dipping shear zone. The crust is c. 5 km thinner below the Central Graben than below the surrounding parts of the Mid North Sea–Ringkøbing-Fyn High. The lower crust is reflective on the western flank of the Central Graben. East-dipping reflections from the lower crust and the upper mantle to the east of the graben may indicate a component of simple shear in the evolution of the rift structure."

    abstract = "Sera of 853 returnees from tropical countries, of 24 cases with amebic liver abscess and of 172 nonexposed German individuals were tested for antibodies to E. histolytica in the enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Antibody results were expressed as “multiple of normal activity (MONA)”. The qualification of the EIA as a routine screening procedure for amebae specific antibodies was investigated and compared to that of the complement fixation test. Based on the symmetric frequency distribution of results from the 172 non-exposed controls the upper one sided limits for 95\% (< 2.8 MONA) and 99\% (< 4.2 MONA) specificity were determined. Routine results below the 95\% specificity limit were considered “inconspicuous”, such between both limits “borderline” and all MONA values exceeding the 99\% specificity limit “conspicuous”. The intention was to thereby secure a high degree of sensitivity for amebae specific antibody in the test. Cases with clinically confirmed liver abscess revealed a one sided lower 95\% sensitivity limit (≥ 12.2 MONA), far above the onset of the defined sensitivity thresholds for conspicuous MONA values. Zusammenfassung Serumproben von 853 Tropenrückkehrern, von 24 Fällen mit Amöbenleberabszeß und 172 nicht exponierten deutschen Kontrollpersonen wurden im Enzymimmuntest (EIT) auf Antikörper gegen E. histolytica untersucht. Die Ergebnisse wurden als „Mehrfaches normaler Aktivität (MeNA)“ quantifiziert. Die Eignung des EIT als Suchtest für amöbenspezifische Antikörper wurde an den Ergebnissen der Komplementbindungsreaktion gemessen. Aus der symmetrischen Häufigkeitsverteilung von Ergebnissen der Kontroll-personen wurden einseitige Grenzen für 95\% (< 2,8 MeNA) und 99\% (< 4,2 MeNA) Spezifität abgeleitet. Ergebnisse aus den Routineuntersuchungen unterhalb der 95\% Spezifitätsgrenze wurden als „unauffällig“, zwischen den beiden Grenzen als „grenzfällig“ und alle MeNA-Werte oberhalb der 99\% Spezifitätsgrenze als „auffällig“ klassifiziert. Dadurch sollte eine höchstmögliche Sensitivität für amöbenspezifische Antikörper im Test erreicht werden. Bei der Auswertung der Antikörperbefunde von Leberabszeßfällen zeigte sich, daß deren einseitige untere 95\% Sensitivitätsgrenze mit ≥ 12,2 MeNA erwartungsgemäß weit über den definierten niedrigen Schwellenwerten für die Sensitivität „auffälliger“ MeNA-Werte lag."

    abstract = "The continuous measurement of sustained atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) is now possible with some permanently implanted devices. Data on this subject remain controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of sustained AT in patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy using pacemakers without backup defibrillators (CRT-P), within the first year after implantation, using strict definition criteria for sustained AT and a systematic review of all high-quality electrographically recorded episodes. The Mona Lisa study was a prospective, multicenter, cohort study carried out from February 2004 to February 2006, with a 12-month follow-up period. Sustained AT was defined as an episode lasting ≥5 minutes; episodes were confirmed by a systematic review of electrograms in the whole study population. Of the 198 patients who underwent CRT-P device implantation and were enrolled in the study, 173 were in stable sinus rhythm at baseline and were included in the analysis (mean age 70 ± 9 years, 66\% men, 91\% in New York Heart Association class III, mean QRS duration 164 ± 26 ms, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 25 ± 7\%). During a mean follow-up period of 9.9 ± 3.6 months, 34 patients experienced ≥1 episode of sustained AT, for an incidence rate of 27.5\% (95\% confidence interval 18.2 to 36.7). Only a history of AT was independently associated with the occurrence of sustained AT within the 12 months after CRT-P device implantation (hazard ratio 2.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.4, p = 0.02). In conclusion, this first prospective electrogram-based evaluation of AT incidence demonstrated that 27\% of patients developed ≥1 episode of sustained AT lasting ≥5 minutes in the 12 months after CRT-P device implantation."

    abstract = "The Tornquist and Iapetus Suture Zones result from amalgamation of three plates (Laurentia, Baltica and Eastern Avalonia) during the Early Paleozoic Caledonian orogeny (∼440Ma). We present a comparison of the velocity structure of the contrasting Proterozoic and Paleozoic lithosphere across the margins of Eastern Avalonia based on two deep seismic experiments, MONA LISA and VARNET in the SE North Sea and SW Ireland, respectively. Both velocity models show three different crustal types: (a) a high-velocity, three-layered shield type Proterozoic crust (in Baltica and Laurentia) to the north; (b) a transitional crust in the central part across the suture zones; and (c) Eastern Avalonian crust to the south. However, the sub-Moho velocities are ∼7.8km/s under the ∼34-km-thick Baltica crust and ∼8.2km/s under the 26-km-thick Eastern Avalonian crust on the MONA LISA-1 profile, in contrast to ∼7.8km/s under the ∼31-km-thick Eastern Avalonian crust and ∼8.1km/s under the ∼33km thick Laurentian crust on the VARNET profile. These differences in the sub-Moho velocity structure are interpreted to be related to a change in subduction polarity between the Tornquist Sea and the Iapetus Ocean or in the direction of shearing in the mantle during collision tectonics."

The museum represents a larger trend where affluent individuals establish prestigious private museums with significant global reach. This study has found Mona to be a highly personal endeavour, providing influential networks in support of the owner's personal and business objectives. It highlights the perception that the museum has had a transformative impact on Tasmania, particularly in adding a sophisticated dimension to the state's cultural visage and a new vibrancy that is thought to resonate strongly with tourists. Previous scholarship has shown that private museums operate in a different context and play by different rules to their public counterparts and this study has shown this to be true in identifying problems with how to govern Mona and the local creative scene trying to negotiate a place within this changing context. Mona has brought credibility to the arts, but set high expectations for the local arts scene, creating entry barriers for young artists and challenging arts institutions with more limited resources."
